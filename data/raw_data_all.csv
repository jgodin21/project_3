Broc_lee_n_Care_itz,Community mock draft Dallas Cowboys results,"Hi everyone, I recently participated as the Dallas Cowboys GM in a community mock draft in r/NFL_Draft. Before I get into details and explanations I will just share our results, however, please read my explanations below before you crucify me:

TRADE: Leighton Vander Esch + 2.51 + 5.179 to New England for 1.23 + 3.100 + 4.125

1.17: K'lavon Chaisson EDGE LSU

TRADE: 1.23 + 2021 6th rounder to Arizona for 2.39 + 3.72

2.39 Laviska Shenault WR Colorado

TRADE: 2.72 + +3.100 + 4.125 for 2.50 + 7.226

2.50 Damon Arnette Cornerback Ohio State

3.82 Jordyn Brooks Linebacker Texas Tech

4.123 Julian Blackmon Safety Utah

TRADE: 5.164 + 7.226 + 7.231 for 5.159

5.159: Benito Jones DT Ole Miss

&amp;#x200B;

I created a survey for everyone so they could share their opinions anonymously without getting flack. We had put 6 players on the trading block. We immediately got strong interest in LVE. Our thought process was that if we could get a 3rd rounder or better we would trade him. We decided to take the deal for the following reasonings:

&amp;#x200B;

\-The trade we eventually took valued him at an early 2nd round pick, which is more than we were hoping to get.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Injury history: LVE has sustained a severe/spinal neck injury that no NFL player has ever come back from to have a significant career. We felt like a rookie was less risk than LVE at this point despite his exceptional 2018 performance.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Lack of scheme fit: We decided to lean into the idea of setting up our defense to run a 3-4/4-3 hybrid in 2020 and transfer fully to a 3-4 in 2021. As a 4-3 LB this made LVE expendable. 

&amp;#x200B;

\-Having just paid D-Law, Jaylon Smith, La'el Collins, Ezekiel Elliott, Amari Cooper, and Dak Prescott due up next it would have been very difficult to pay LVE after 2021. Plus, due to our new defensive schematic philosophy LVE likely would have walked anyway and we at best would have gotten a compensatory pick. Trading him now nets us higher value and gets us a rookie we can control the rights to through 2023 or later.

&amp;#x200B;

Day 1: Going into day 1 we had a strong gameplan: If Okudah is there at 10 trade up and get him. If not we sit at 17, take Kristian Fulton, and if Chaisson is there at 23 take him as well. If not, we had an excellent trade down option to 28 with Baltimore.

&amp;#x200B;

Pick 1.17:  Okudah was off the board at 4. By the time we were on the clock at 17 about 15 random people had appeared in our war room. We took a vote between Fulton and Chaisson. Chaisson won so he was the pick. 

&amp;#x200B;

TRADE down from 23: We were hoping Fulton would fall to 23 but he was taken at 22. We hit up Baltimore to trade down and they backed out. We immediately got 2 other trade down offers. With no players on the board that we valued at  23 available we decided to trade down to 39. We thought one of Johnson/Diggs/Gladney/Terrell would be there.

&amp;#x200B;

Pick 2.39: Then there was a rush on CBs at the end of the first/beginning of the second. Suddenly all the CBs we valued at 39 were gone. We decided to take Tee Higgins, then he was gone as well. With no trade down options available we decided to take the BPA and trade back into the mid-2nd to get a CB at better value. We voted between Michael Pittman Jr and Laviska Shenault. Shenault won by a landslide.

&amp;#x200B;

TRADE/2.50 After missing out on CBs we liked at 17, 23, and 39 we were absolutely desperate to address what was our unanimous #1 need: cornerback. We considered Damon Arnette the last of the tier 2 cornerbacks still available. We negotiated deals to move up to 48, 49, 50, 51, and 52 for him. We got the best deal from the Bears for pick 50 and when our guy was still on the board we pulled the trigger.

&amp;#x200B;

Day 2: Now our attention turned to the large hole created by the LVE trade. At the start of day 2 we had a list of 6 players, inside linebackers, nose tackles, anda hybrid player, who we had a second round grade on. If one of our LBS were there we were going to take them, if not we were going to take a NT and trade our 5th round pick to the Jets for Avery Williamson. 

&amp;#x200B;

Pick 3.82: Of course with our luck there was a rush on LBs and NT at the start of day 2. &amp; 7 had gone off the board when we got on the clock. Luckily, 2 guys we had 2nd round grades on were still available. We voted between Jordyn Brooks and James Burgess. Jordyn Brooks won the vote and we got our guy!

&amp;#x200B;

Pick 4.123: At the start of round 4 there were about 5 interior offensive lineman that we had 2-3 round grades on still available. Our gameplan was Solomon Kindley &gt; Kenny Robinson &gt; best IOL available if they have a 3rd round grade &gt; Jalen Hurts. Literally in the last 10 picks before we got on the board all of the guys we discussed were gone. Our guy who scouted DBs had a 4th round grade on Julian Blackmon. So we took him at what we thought was proper value.

&amp;#x200B;

TRADE: Going into the 5th there were 2 guys left that we had 4th round grades on. The 6th and 7th rounds had been postponed until the next day and none of us wanted to show up so we were trying to get rid of the 2 7th round picks. We decided that if James Proche or Benito Jones kept falling we would aggressively trade up for them. 

&amp;#x200B;

Pick 5.159: At 159 both targets were still on the board. If we hadn't gotten Shenault in round 2 we would have takene Proche, however, we wanted to get a DT who could develop for a year and provide depth once Poe/McCoy are gone next year. So, Benito Jones was the pick.

&amp;#x200B;

How do these guys fit our team?

K'Lavon Chaisson: This guy speaks for himself. We need another edge rusher to be able to run a 3-4. Being the best guy still on the board at our 2nd biggest need we couldn't pass him up.

&amp;#x200B;

Laviska Shenault: This was a pure luxury pick. There were no slot receivers that we wanted at pick 39 but Shenault has huge upside and could take over as our #2 if Gallup leaves at the end of his rookie contract. With Coop/TP/Gallup/Devin Smith all having experience in the slot we felt we had a role for a big body like Shenault.

&amp;#x200B;

Damon Arnette: He is simply exactly what we need. A dynamic coverage CB who can make tackles and produce turnovers. He may not be our #1 right away but he can contribute year 1.

&amp;#x200B;

Jordyn Brooks: For years our defense has struggled at stopping the run. Even with LVE we got trampled by the Rams in the playoffs. Brooks is one of if not the single best run stopping linebacker in college football. Not only that but he is the last piece we need to be able to run a 3-4 set.

&amp;#x200B;

Julian Blackmon: We felt he was a guy who had starting potential if he could add a considerable amount of weight/strength, with Clinton-Dix on a 1 year deal it could be a perfect transition for him to sit for a year and then slide into the starting lineup.

&amp;#x200B;

Benito Jones: This guy was an absolute steal in the 5th. A 4 year starter at Ole Miss who thrived his senior year after a transition to a 3-4 defense. He is built like Vince Wilfork and has the potential to be a dominant NT in the league. He can sit behind Poe and McCoy for a year and learn from some of the best before potentially earning the job his sophomore year.

&amp;#x200B;

All in all not everything worked out the way we wanted it to. The LVE trade was much less attractive after we took Shenault at 39 but we stand by our decision. Every player we took was dominant in college and has potential to become an NFL starter. We ended with 4 guys who can start day 1. Prior to the draft we gave our picks grades of: round 1, three round 2 grades, and two round 4 guys.

Edit: I should note that we traded LVE partially to make the mock interesting and fun for us. I am not endorsing that we trade LVE in real life.","Community mock draft Dallas Cowboys results Hi everyone, I recently participated as the Dallas Cowboys GM in a community mock draft in r/NFL_Draft.

For all of these, I made a concious decision of not going after interior OL. Between Williams, McGovern, and Looney, we can find a OC and LG.

**Mock Draft 1** Filling Holes

R1P17: Grant Delpit S- I basically got wiped out. Would've liked to have traded down because Herbert was still there, but can't trade down on this system. Still, Delpit would make a really good center fielder for the next 5+ years

R2P51: AJ Terrell CB- Surprised to see him here as I think he'll go bottom of the 1st/top of the 2nd. But, finding him at 51 really helps make up for having to reach for Delpit.

R3P82: Davon Hamilton DT- Fatties Only 2020! Hamilton is 6'4 320 and can play both 1 gap and 2 gap. With Trysten Hill as our only other DT, I thought it was important to add depth here to help keep our LBs clean.

R4P123: Devin Duvernay WR- Small, but fast and isn't afraid of contact. Not the shiftiest slot receiver, but catches everything. 

R5P164: Harrison Bryant TE- Giving Dak more pass catchers is never a bad thing. Would use Bryant like Jimmy Graham and just have him lined out in the slot until he puts on some muscle. This is the kind of pass catching TE we want threatening the middle of the field.

R5P179: Shaquille Quarterman LB- 2 down LB who is awesome in run support. Not a coverage LB so won't help us on 3rd down. But he would help improve our run defense and STs.

R7P231: Myles Bryant CB- Doubling up at CB with 4 of our CBs in contract years. Bryant is small and shifty, but build to play slot CB. Quick, fast and doesn't mind getting rough inside.  

**Mock Draft 2** Defense Wins Championships

R1P17: K'Lavon Chaisson DE- I'm not as big on Chaisson as others but I was limited in my options here. Was wiped out again with no option to trade down. 

R2P51: Damon Arnette CB- Good size and speed along with experience playing outside and slot. Can compete for a starting spot this year.

R3P82: Terrell Burgess S- Very smart, instinctive player. Is second to no one in preparation. Great understanding of what's happening around him...just not the most athletic or experienced player.

R4P123: Darnell Mooney WR- Kind of small but extremely fast and quick. Very explosive out of routes. Would be a full-time slot receiver.

R5P164: David Woodward LB- A legitimate starting caliber LB who has a history of injuries, including a season ender in 2019. Has a knack for finding the football and has outstanding prep habits. He's a poor man's Sean Lee

R5P179: Raequan Williams DT- 6'4, 308 has the size but needs to improve his strength. Would make a good back up DT with a possibility of being a solid 1T down the road.

R7P231: AJ Green CB- Double dipping at CB again. Good size as a boundary corner and is physical enough to disrupt receivers. Not the fastest guy but plays well in press man.

**Mock Draft 3** Team 40 Burger

R1P17: Jerry Jeudy WR- Just gonna score all the points here. Adding Jeudy in our receiver corps would be insane. Broken legs everywhere in opposing secondaries as Cooper, Jeudy, and Gallup juke everyone.

R2P51: K.J. Hamler WR- Seriously, gimme all the points. Hamler replaces Tavon Austin as the return man/gadget guy. Dude runs a 4.3 40. Stretch the field, end arounds, screens. Let the guy make plays.

R3P82: Adam Trautman TE- We ain't done adding offensive skill players. Trautman doesn't have a lot of experience at the position but he has some freaky traits. 

R4P123: Reggie Robinson II CB- Finally, a defensive player. Still have to fill some holes. Not the most technically sound but is really good in press man and against the run.

R5P164: Julian Blackmon S- Recently transitioned from CB to Safety. Has the size and speed, but needs to gain experience. Luckily, he will be backing up two veterans this year.

R5P179: Bravvion Roy DT- 6'1, 320 built like a house. He would make a good rotational 1T to give Poe some opportunities at 3T

R7P231: Dante Olson LB- Probably never going to help much in defense but can be a ST ace. Can run and just absolutely lays people out.

That was a couple examples. Anything you liked/disliked? Have any of your own you'd like to add?","A Few Cowboy Mock Drafts Playing around on thedraftnetwork draft machine. Was using PFF's earlier because they have trading but doesn't seem to be working now for me. For all of these, I made a concious decision of not going after interior OL. Between Williams, McGovern, and Looney, we can find a OC and LG.

**Mock Draft 1** Filling Holes

R1P17: Grant Delpit S- I basically got wiped out. Would've liked to have traded down because Herbert was still there, but can't trade down on this system. Still, Delpit would make a really good center fielder for the next 5+ years

R2P51: AJ Terrell CB- Surprised to see him here as I think he'll go bottom of the 1st/top of the 2nd. But, finding him at 51 really helps make up for having to reach for Delpit.

DrJamesPGrossweiner,Odds of getting top non qb or ot prospect at 17,"So the way I see it, the cowboys likely aren't interested in a qb or a 1st round tackle in this year's draft. I want to evaluate the odds that they get a no question 1st round talent at pick 17. The way I see it a 1st rounder is a game changing talent and I think there are 10 of them. At wr: jeudy, lamb and ruggs. At edge: young and chaisson. At idl: brown and kinlaw. At cb: okudah and Henderson. At lb: Simmons.
There are also wills, wirfs, Thomas and Becton as no question 1st round talent tackles as well as burrows, Tua, love and Herbert as possible 1st rounders. We have to hope that six of these go before the cowboys pick at 17. How likely is it? I actually think the odds aren't bad.
1. Bengals almost definitely burrows
2. Redskins young or trade to team for tua.
3. Lions going to lose 1 here unless there is a trade.
4. Giants Simmons is often mocked here but it go any direction but qb i would think.
5. Dolphins likely looking at a qb. They also have an ot need. 
6. Chargers will want a qb of the future at some point. Line needs help.
7. Panthers see chargers
8. Cardinals might need o line help more than anyone. They might not be able to pass on an elite wr tho. 
9. Jaguars likely taking one of the 10. Ot is possible. 
10. Browns need line help bad. Mayfield needs longer to drop than most qbs and their tackles are nothing special. 
11. Jets are a toss up. I can't see them passing on a special wr but they also need line help on both sides.
12. Raiders need wr and cb. Probably one off the list here.
13. 49ers. Who knows. Probably bpa which would be one off the list.
14. Bucs could do anything. Toss up.
15. I have heard that the broncos either want ruggs or an ot to pair with lock. I hope its ot. 
16. Falcons had one of the all time worst defenses last year. Expect help there. 

To sum it up likely qb pick teams: 2
Teams who wouldn't be a surprise to pick qb: 2
Its possible: 1
Unlikely: 1
Teams with ot as a top need: 3
Not a surprise: 4

So realisticly we can assume that Tua and burrows go before the cowboys. That leaves 4 out of 14 picks needing to go our way. I would guess that it is likely the chargers or panthers take love or Herbert. Its possible they both go here but these teams also need tackle help. Then we need 2-3 tackle picks between the giants, chargers, panthers, cardinals, jags, browns, jets, bucs, and broncos. Cards giants bucs and browns need tackles bad so I would feel safe giving half of them a tackle. That puts the tally at 2 locked in qb and two locked in ot picks. At that point I would say that it is very possible and even probable that 2 more of these players go before the cowboys pick giving the boys a day 1 playmaker. 

If it doesn't work out I would be tempted to trade back as several teams will still see these players the cowboys don't need as tier 1 players. There are great tier 2 wrs cbs rbs idl and safeties to take.

They also might go with the top corner or safety on their board. There is also aj Espinosa to consider who is a high floor low ceiling lineman. 

Bottom line this class is loaded and I hope the cowboys can get a talent that would normally be top 10 at pick 17. If they don't there are still many players to be excited about. 

EDIT: dang, this is why you don't post sleep deprived. We need 7 to go. Thats less likely but certainly not impossible. Maybe trade back is the way to go and get a tier 2 safety, wr and corner. Or how about give up a 3rd to jump the falcons. Any takers?","Odds of getting top non qb or ot prospect at 17 So the way I see it, the cowboys likely aren't interested in a qb or a 1st round tackle in this year's draft.

sunnyglacier6,How likely is it Henderson will be there at 17?,"After thinking hard over the most realistic and ideal pick at #17 without a trade up or down would be Henderson. The best chance would be if the majority of the QBs OTs and WR go in the first 15. But even at that point the falcons have a huge need for a CB since Trufant left and are #16. I would be stoked with Henderson at #17 to help Chido and Lewis and give us a solid secondary to grow with for the future. I think we could get a quality prospect like Duggar or Chinn or hopefully Winfield if he slips at 51 and land someone like pitmann, Claypool, Reagor etc with the round 3 pick who could compete for the 3rd wr position for us. I think the drop off from CB prospects is deeper than the WR and safety class.

mcontreras484,Dak Prescott is a great quarterback but a terrible leader,"Prescott’s stats and accomplishments speak for themselves; he’s a top ten quarterback with true athleticism and skill to win games. Problem is that he isn’t a true leader. He might own the locker room but he doesn’t have the leadership qualities that elite quarterbacks have.

After refusing to back down over and over on his contract and forcing the cowboys front office to waste a franchise tag on him, I’ve started to wonder if Prescott is really our franchise quarterback. The cowboys were undisciplined, arrogant, and got outplayed by “less talented” teams ever since Prescott took the reigns. Of course there are things that aren’t in Daks control that loses games but he hasn’t been able to overcome them like an elite quarterback should. Now he wants to be the highest paid player in nfl history with almost no post season success. A true leader would see that taking a smaller contract would mean more opportunities to sign talent(Byron Jones and Robert Quinn etc). 

Now the new factor is his blatant disregard for public health safety after he hosted a party of 30 people during a lockdown and went out to a public gym to workout. These are moves we expect from rookies, not the future franchise quarterback of the Dallas Cowboys.","Dak Prescott is a great quarterback but a terrible leader Prescott’s stats and accomplishments speak for themselves; he’s a top ten quarterback with true athleticism and skill to win games.

randybobandy54,Cowboys Draft Prospects,"So I know a lot of people don't have the time to scout prospects so I wanted to help out and give y'all a write up about the prospects the Cowboys could potentially draft.

&amp;#x200B;

**CeeDee Lamb WR Oklahoma:** In my opinion Lamb is the top WR in the 2020 Draft, can play inside and outside and be a matchup nightmare for any CB. He's got some of the best hands in the draft and he's easily the most elusive WR's in the draft, and a very underrated route runner. He could step in day 1 and be one of the best slot WR's in the league.

&amp;#x200B;

**Jerry Jeudy WR Alabama:** Jeudy is considered by most to be the top WR in the 2020 Draft, Jeudy is hands down the best route runner in this draft, he makes defenders look lost when they attempt to cover him. Jeudy has sneaky speed to go along with his outstanding route running. Jeudy is another guy like Lamb that can come in day 1 and be a great contributor to any team.

&amp;#x200B;

**Henry Ruggs III WR Alabama:** Ruggs is a lot different than Lamb and Jeudy, Ruggs is the fastest player in this class by a landslide, he's got elite burner speed and there aren't many people in the NFL that can keep up with him. With the speed Ruggs has he will be able to take the top off the defense any given play and desires safety help at all times. Ruggs wasn't targeted as often as other WR's in this draft so his numbers are lower but don't let that deter you from seeing the potential he possesses.

&amp;#x200B;

**Derrick Brown DT Auburn:** There isn't much to say about Derrick Brown, he's easily the best DT in the draft and is downright dominate, his combine scores might push him down the board but he's still one of the best prospects in this draft. Brown is strong against the run and can be one of the best pass rushing DT's in the league, Cowboys would need a lot of luck for Brown to fall to them.

&amp;#x200B;

**Javon Kinlaw DT South Carolina:** Kinlaw is one of the more interesting prospects in the draft class,He had very average production in college but everything about him says first round pick. Kinlaw showed up to the senior bowl and showed why he should be a top 20 pick but the one thing that could hold him back is his knee issue, Kinlaw wasn't able to finish senior bowl week because his knee flared up again, while this could be nothing it is also something to keep an eye on for the future.

&amp;#x200B;

**K'Lavon Chaisson Edge LSU:** Now this could be an interesting pick because much like Kinlaw, Chaisson wasn't the most productive player in college but a lot of that could be attributed to his age, Chaisson will only be 21 when the season starts (Hopefully the Season starts on time) which could be why he is such a raw prospect. For Chaisson to fit on the Cowboys he would probably have to add on another 15-20 pounds and help get stronger. I honestly feel like Chaisson is going to be the pick come draft day.

&amp;#x200B;

**Zack Baun Edge/LB Wisconsin:** Baun is one of my favorite prospects in the 2020 draft, Baun is probably the most versatile defensive player in the draft behind Isaiah Simmons, Baun can drop into coverage and can also rush the passer. Baun is actually one of the better pass rushers in this draft which is impressive considering his size. Baun isn't one of the favorite names in the draft for pick 17 but i can tell you Baun is going to make a fan base very happy once he reaches his full potential. 

&amp;#x200B;

**A.J. Epenesa Edge Iowa:** Before the combine i was high on Epenesa, he was one of the best run stopping edge players in the draft and has a strong pass rush move. I do think Epenesa needs to learn more pass rushing moves because NFL lineman will catch on very quickly. The issue with Epenesa is that he's one of the worst athletes in the draft, he ran an atrocious 5.04 40 yard dash which isn't the best indicator of a good player but he projects more as 3-4 DE and i don't see him as a fit for the Cowboys.

&amp;#x200B;

**Kenneth Murray LB Oklahoma:** Id like to start off by saying i don't think Murray will even be considered for the Cowboys pick in the first round. Murray is a young athletic linebacker who is very raw, I don't see Murray translating to the NFL well, I think he misses far too many tackles and doesn't know how to cover. Let just say this, if for some reason the Cowboys draft Kenneth Murray at pick 17 I don't believe we will see LVE play football again, like I said i highly doubt that happens but if it does it tells us a lot about the health of LVE.

&amp;#x200B;

**C.J. Henderson CB Florida:** I like C.J. Henderson a lot, I think he's the 2nd best CB in the draft behind Okudah, Henderson has the ideal size and speed of a #1 CB in the NFL. Henderson is a fantastic man coverage CB with some aggressive tendencies which can be both good and bad. There won't be any CB's available at 17 that will be able to replace Byron Jones but i think Henderson is the best of the remaining CB's that can come in and produce immediately.

&amp;#x200B;

**Kristian Fulton CB LSU:** Fulton has me confused, I really want to like his tape and his skills but he just doesn't come off a successful starting CB to me, there are times he looks fantastic in coverage and then there are times he looks completely lost in coverage. I hate to say it but i see too much Morris Claiborne in him. Something inside me makes me believe that if Chaisson is gone Fulton will be the pick at 17.

&amp;#x200B;

**Jeff Gladney CB TCU:** I think pick 17 is a little rich for my taste but i do like Gladney, he's a versatile CB that can play both man and zone efficiently. Gladney has very good football IQ and has fantastic footwork which should translate to the NFL. Gladney has good size, Id like to see him add some more muscle so he can improve his press ability but nonetheless he's going to be a good player in the NFL.

&amp;#x200B;

**Xavier McKinney S Alabama:** Xavier McKinney is going to be a really good football player in the NFL, He's going to translate more as a box safety and that's one of the bigger needs of the Cowboys, I think McKinney would be the perfect complement to Xavier Woods or Haha Clinton Dix and could be the perfect 3rd safety. McKinney is fantastic when it comes to tackling in the open field. While i really like McKinney Id prefer the Cowboys trade down from 17 if they are going to take him.

&amp;#x200B;

**Grant Delpit S LSU:** I think this one is pretty self explanatory, we know the strengths and flaws of Delpit, he's the best ball hawking safety in the draft but can't tackle to save his life, Delpit is the complete opposite of Xavier McKinney, I don't believe Delpit will get first round consideration but this write up is necessary just in case, personally Id let Delpit go to the 2nd round before i consider taking him.

pivotalsquash,Favorite play from active cowboys,"Just trying to get some off-season talks going. Maybe watch some highlights. 

What are your favorite plays from our active cowboys?
Some for me
Zeke - 2016 broke through the Bengals line for a huge run and a TD plays started from our own 40

Dak - this one is probably a tie between his deep ball to Dez in the 2016 steelers game after dez's father had passed or his big dick run against the Seahawks in the 2018 playoffs where he got to the one yardline from a huge gain.

Cooper - his broken tackle and TD run against the redskins the year we got him on Thanksgiving. That was the moment I knew the first round was worth it. (Even if I got kicked out to my fantasy playoffs from that play)

Jayson Smith - his fumble recovery for a TD against Tampa Bay

I'll probably add more if this post gets attention or steal some of yalls!","Favorite play from active cowboys Just trying to get some off-season talks going. Maybe watch some highlights.

thedirtytroll13,Trade Kai?,"We extended Kai Forbath on a team friendly deal for 1 year and less than 1 million. That seemed like an obvious stop gap and most people I know and this sub seemed content with that as we lost a few games due to kicking last year. I thought we had our favorite going in to camp and would have a token competition like most years. Then the team announced the Greg ""The Leg"" Zuerlein to 3 years and $7.5MM with more than $2MM guaranteed. 


This is not a deal the front office makes if they are undecided. The length of the contract and the guarantees tell us this much. Barring a disastrous preseason Greg is the kicker for 3 years. He was with Bones in L.A. and he is Bones's guy going forward.

So now we have our place kicking situation ""solved"" for 3 years and a NFL starter on an affordable 1 year deal. If we keep Kai the most likely scenario is simply cutting him but I'd like to see is try to spin him for a pick in a couple weeks or maybe a player but that seems less likely for some reason.

GilBrandt,Is Amari Cooper really the Great Disappearing Act he is made out to be?,"So is Amari the ONLY top tier WR that disappears? Or is this a classic over exaggeration by the media/internet? 

I always hear this about Amari, even before he played for the Cowboys. Of course the star on the helmet tends to make sure these types of things don’t go away. Is it true? I always believed it since I didn’t watch him on the Raiders, but through him joining the Cowboys and keeping up with stats, thanks to fantasy, I feel my opinion on him is changing.

[Here is a quick table I put together of Amari compared to some top receivers in the league over the last two seasons](https://imgur.com/a/UTY7xvV)

Why two seasons? Because that’s roughly how long he has been with the Cowboys and it gives most of these guys 30 games to compare, which feels fair. 

Also the first two columns of stats inspired this post. These columns show how many times each receiver “disappeared” in a simple, but I feel fair way. If a receiver had a stat line of 55 yards and 0 TDs then I counted that as “disappeared”, but if they had a stat line of 35 yards and 1 TD then I didn’t count it because they contributed a score which is super valuable as we all know.

Does this table tell the whole story? No This table also doesn’t clearly show when a player is injured or not exactly. This is a SIMPLE way of looking at it and shows all these top guys disappear occasionally.

My Conclusion:

Is Amari worth the giant contract? Not necessarily, but I believe he is invaluable to the team and Dak. He isn’t a diva. I trust the front office and the contract will even out in a couple years. Ultimately I believe he stacks up well with the top guys, but might be more of a 1b top receiver and not 1a like Thomas or Julio.

Michael Thomas is a god, a whiny one, but a god.","Is Amari Cooper really the Great Disappearing Act he is made out to be? So is Amari the ONLY top tier WR that disappears? Or is this a classic over exaggeration by the media/internet?

iFuktUrMom,Team Poll," Hello, r/cowboys,

I’m here for a bit of field research. My buddies and I are having a competition this year to see who can make the most accurate 2020 mock draft. So, in order to familiarize myself with teams better, I thought I would visit teams’ subreddits to poll the fans on their thoughts. If you could answer some or all of the questions below in as little or as much detail as you want, it would be greatly appreciated.

Please keep in mind that I’m trying to make an **accurate** mock draft. Not a fantasy one. For example, I’m from r/detroitlions , and while I *really* want us to take Okudah or Simmons, I think Patricia and Quinn are gonna fall in love with Derrick Brown’s character and draft him. 

My questions: 

What are your team’s biggest positional needs?

Of those needs, what type of player fits your team best? (Ex: do you need a run-blocking tackle or a pass-blocking tackle?)

Does your coach and/or GM have any draft tendencies? (Ex: do they draft more based on team need rather than talent available?)

Lastly, is there any other general information I should know about your team for the mock?

Thank you so much if you answered any amount of questions. Good luck in the draft this year and let’s all just hope there will be football being played come September.","Team Poll  Hello, r/cowboys,

17 Round 1: Trevon Diggs CB Alabama

Fulton and McKinney were available but I can't get over the potential Diggs has.  

51 Round 2: Brandon Aiyuk WR Arizona State 

Fantastic YAC man. Will shine in Kellen Moore's offense. Can return kicks and punts as well. 

82 Round 3: Ashtyn Davis S California 

Love his potential as well, SPARQ freak and has a good football mind, makes a lot of game changing plays. 

123 Round 4: Jonathan Greenard EDGE Florida 

Fell into my lap here, I was hoping for Alex Highsmith but Greenard is a steal in round 4. Needs to get healthy (wrist injury). Another athletic freak.

165 Round 5: Jason Strowbridge DL North Carolina 

NFL build and strength, needs to improve blockshedding technique, flashed at the Senior Bowl. 

180 Round 5: Colby Parkinson TE Stanford
 
Huge target at 6'7"", can run routes from anywhere on the field. Needs to improve blocking but has the frame to become a good blocker. 

232 Round 7: Braden Mann P Texas A&amp;M 

Lets face it, Chris Jones' time is up in Dallas. We get the most impactful special teamer in the draft.

Chuck_Foolery,Something I heard on radio yesterday that could be intriguing (regarding 2021 draft),"So it was said that, in the case that there is no NFL this season, the NFL could potentially do a draft next year that was similar to the NHL draft that landed Pittsburgh Sidney Crosby back in either 2005 or 2006 due to a lockout. The prospect was then brought up that Trevor Lawrence could basically end up being available for every team there is and then they talked about who they thought would absolutely pass on Lawrence because their QBs were good enough and who would have to genuinely think about taking him. I heard teams like Baltimore, Arizona, Seattle, Philly, LA Rams, and even Cleveland passing. What stood out to me the most was that the Cowboys with Dak was not a sure things as far as passing on Lawrence. 

So let's say my some weird ass alternative universe we ended up with a pick in the 2021 draft that could land us Lawrence. Let's also assume two scenarios, one where Dak is signed by then and one where he isn't but we're still in negotiations and it looks likely we'll sign him...

Do you pass on Lawrence or do you take Lawrence?

Now, in my personal opinion, I kind of think all of the hype on Lawrence is a little exaggerated. So, for me, I pass in both scenarios. But I know there's lots that feel Lawrence is the next coming of Manning. 

So what would you do if you had to choose between Dak and Trevor coming off a year in which absolutely no football has been played?","Something I heard on radio yesterday that could be intriguing (regarding 2021 draft) So it was said that, in the case that there is no NFL this season, the NFL could potentially do a draft next year that was similar to the NHL draft that landed Pittsburgh Sidney Crosby back in either 2005 or 2006 due to a lockout.

glorypron,High Character Football Players are a farce," I love football.  I love the Dallas Cowboys. The Cowboys signed Aldon Smith. I am excited about adding a talented player to my favorite team, and I am rooting for Aldon Smith to redeem himself on the football field and off. However, lets address one of the biggest lies in football - teams want high character players. No they don't! They love freakishly talented knuckleheads like Aldon Smith who can't get out of their own way. They have leverage over knuckleheads like Aldon Smith, because without football and his worth on the field Aldon Smith might be working at a grocery store or staring at a wall of a jail cell. With his ability to pass rush, good health, and high character Aldon Smith would be asking for $20 million a year. Instead, the Cowboys are getting him for barely the vet minimum and if he's a good boy he might begin to earn something approaching real money.

Crobs02,A Look at Our Post-FA Needs and the Success of the Front Office,"GMs dream of a draft where they have no needs. Of course, that’s rarely the case. Obviously we want Dallas to be in a BPA position in the draft, and looking at the roster at the end of the year the BPA dream looked bleak. After the Aldon Smith signing I got increasingly excited because our BPA dream actually looks more attainable. I thought I’d break down our needs and how they’ve evolved.

An important note: our free agency signings have not fixed our holes for the future, but I am strictly looking at the needs of the team going into 2020.

CB: We did not replace Byron, and Awuzie being our probable #1 CB is not a situation we want to be in. This is an urgent need.

DE: After losing Quinn this was an urgent need. Randy Gregory looks to return this year, and Aldon Smith was an elite pass rusher at one point in his career. IF Randy Gregory comes back I think this position isn’t a need and we at least have a 1 year solution.

DT: Even if we kept Collins we had 2 huge holes. The addition of McCoy and Poe has filled these 2 holes.

WR: Losing Cobb gives us a need here, but this may not be an urgent need, as Tony Pollard may step in. Devin Smith could line up here as well. I’d say this is a need, but this isn’t an urgent need at all. If the FO is comfortable with Pollard in the slot I’d even say this isn’t a need.

S: Jeff Heath was not a starter, and losing him made an already deep hole even deeper. Signing Clinton-Dix filled this hole.

TE: Depending on who you ask we needed to bring someone in. Personally I like Jarwin and Schultz, but bringing Blake Bell in removes this need. 

P: Chris Jones sucks. We need to bring someone in, which we can do. Do I want to draft Braden Mann? Yes. But we can also get a UDFA here. So yes it’s a need, but not an urgent need for the draft.

C: Losing Frederick is going to hurt, but we did play 2018 without him and his replacement played well. This is not a need in the short term with Looney.

Looking at this our only urgent need is CB, and then we have a possible hole at WR. That’s pretty good, and we still have 3 weeks to bring someone in at each position. An impact player will fall to 17, and this team is on the cusp of being able to take whoever they want at that position.

We definitely don’t want them ever feeling an urge to draft someone, so who can they sign? Fortunately there are plenty of guys still left. 

Prince Amukamara is one guy I’d love to see brought in at CB. He’s not our long term guy, but he is a decent player who is better than nothing. I think Amukamara’s play is about what you can reasonable expect out of a rookie CB. Logan Ryan would obviously be dope, but the price tag is too high there.

WR has more options since slot isn’t as big of a priority given our current options. Taylor Gabriel or Ted Ginn Jr. are my top choices here as either a 1 or 2 year option.

Dallas absolutely has long term needs, that will come in a future post. But preparing for next year is the priority, and the front office’s approach so far has been amazing. Sign temporary solutions, draft long term fixes is the sustainable way to run a team, and it is very encouraging to see Dallas on the verge of being able to go completely BPA and get ahead of any of our 2021 or 2022 needs.","A Look at Our Post-FA Needs and the Success of the Front Office GMs dream of a draft where they have no needs.

w675,Why is no one talking about the fact that all these defensive line additions are most likely to take the pressure off D-Law?,"These moves are calculated. It's easy in the offseason to get concerned by losing talent, but remember we have one of the most gifted pass rushers in the entire league. 

The names on our defensive line are insane. Will they live up to past expectations? That'd be amazing, but probably not. Regardless, they are still names you have to significantly game plan for. 

Suddenly, the other team is like, oh fuck we forgot about DeMarcus fucking Lawrence and he's wrecking us!! Last year it was only Quinn and Tank that teams had to worry about. Next season, even if these new guys don't over perform, they are still several names that teams will have to plan for, and by direct result, Tank will thrive. The Cowboys know this, and this is all with intention.

DeMarcus Lawrence o/u 15 sacks?","Why is no one talking about the fact that all these defensive line additions are most likely to take the pressure off D-Law? These moves are calculated.

swiper_no_swagger,What is a ‘real QB’?,"Whenever the topic of Dak comes up on a Cowboys social media page, there’s always some comment that goes along the lines of: why won’t we get rid of him and get a REAL Qb? Or when the nfl made a post about Tony Romo’s first start, the top comment was something along the lines of: ‘the last time Dallas had a real QB’. So what is a ‘real QB’? Technically every QB in the league is a real QB. If it means elite, there are only a handful of them in the league at a certain time and they don’t grow on trees. Also, why haven’t I seen this comment made towards guys like Derek Carr or Andy Dalton, both guys who are seen as middle of the road QBs with their own struggles?

Btw, this isn’t a post on whether or not Dak deserves a big contract as I’ve seen these comments even before news of contract negotiations started coming out.","What is a ‘real QB’?

thatguy1717,Sign or Draft a Swing OT?,"Assuming OTC is caught up, which I don't know that they are because I don't see Poe or Joe Thomas on the list, we have about $15.3M in space. However, Spotrac doesn't show them either and has us at $18M in space. So, let's just say we are working with about $15M for now. Should we sign a veteran swing tackle, draft one (and where), or rely on our current roster?

My hope before Frederick retired was that McGovern would be able to step up at LG and Williams could move into the swing OT spot. But, if McGovern will be battling Joe Looney for the OC spot, I don't see how we move Williams to tackle this year.

Currently on the roster behind the starters are Mitch Hyatt and Brandon Knight. IIRC, Hyatt played a bit at RT last year and wasn't terrible. 

Some names still out in free agency would be Cordy Glenn (31), Kelvin Beachum (31), Greg Robinson (28), James Hurst (29), Cam Erving (28), Germain Ifedi (26), along with several other cheaper guys.

Lastly, there's the draft. I don't know a lot about the OTs in this draft because I have spent zero time caring until recently. But, I've heard after the top 4 guys, it kind of drops off quickly. But, if you know any mid-round prospects, please let us know.

So where would you prefer we find our swing OT?","Sign or Draft a Swing OT?

functionalsports,NFL Draft Scenarios - Reddit Community Mock Draft v2,"Hey Cowboys fans,

I'm launching the 2nd version (post free agency) of the Reddit community mock. The first attempt was fun, but I didn't include trades and had a couple of other improvements to make. This time, I'm doing a bit of prep work. I'm going to ask a few questions and please discuss. It will help me facilitate trades for the his project. Simply up vote what you like the most and I will move forward with whatever option the committee wants. Then when all is said and done, I will launch the draft, have you make the selections. I'll also be facilitating trade offers between boards. This should be fun. Last time, we got 30 of the 32 boards participating.

Questions:

1. Would you trade down from the #17 overall selection? Yes/no? If so, what's the farthest you trade back?
2. Would you trade UP from your first rounder in order to grab another player you don't think will be there?  If so, what pick range would you be targeting? 
3. Would you consider trading later/future picks to move up for another first rounder? If so, what player or players would you target and where?

I'm going to keep a spreadsheet of scenarios and then when we're live, I'm going to have teams make the picks, propose trades and all that. Should be fun for NFL Draft geeks like myself (and you as well hopefully).","NFL Draft Scenarios - Reddit Community Mock Draft v2 Hey Cowboys fans,

Hi Guys,

Just an update. There was a lot of interest in making more of these shirts from yesterday's post and I am in the process of working through the logistics.

I originally used a local shop but have since moved to another state. I contacted another shop and am getting a sample sent to me to see the quality. 

Once I get the new shirt and approve the quality (also an ok from the mods to distribute) I'll start the ordering process.

Thanks for being patient (never did anything like this before) and thanks for all the love on the shirt!

P.S. if anyone has tips or resources to make and distribute shirts in bulk (I was thinking of dropshipping, too) please message me. Thanks!","Cowboys x Gorillaz Shirt ***UPDATE*** [Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/cowboys/comments/fpbte0/made_this_last_year_and_thought_you_guys_would)

fallon47,What I am expecting from Big D this year.,"First off with powers the powers that be and lord willing we'll have a season that gets played. Health and safety take precedence over all else and with corvid-19 running ramped. The lives of every man woman and child matter far greater than any game played. 
   Now with that being said if the greatest sport ever invented does get under way I've a few wishes that I would like granted.

 1.  Could the linebacker core stay healthy for at least 14 games. That would be amazing. Being able to call  shifts and package changes on the fly is key to running a fluent defensive scheme. The Mic linebacker needs to know how to read the offence and adjust accordingly. Communication is key along with being quick alert and decisive. So our back up needs to know his isht as well.

 2. Could the damn media get off our quarterback for christ sakes. Yeah I get it The Dallas Cowboys are Americas Team (still want to know why that title is relevant) and all of the f ing pen pushers and keyboard jockeys love to write about that position. But come on I don't see Hmmm let me think oh yeah Green Bay, Pittsburgh, Indie, San Fransisco, Denver or any other team who's had prolific Quarterbacks get ridden so hard that even a prostitute in her prime would be like ""Get off already enough's enough's. You can keep the damn money just leave"". Notice I did leave New England off of the list cause I'm waiting to see what they have to say about Brady's departure and his replacement. I've said for years that Brady and Belichick were only good together and that ship has now sailed. It's been a fire sail over in Boston Common and they still gonna be broke HA (cheating bastards). Oh sorry it's just we hates them but my rant is done.

 3. Could I please get a secondary that is worth a isht. Tired of reflecting on the 90's team that had Terrence Newman and Primetime. Now granted that was before the change up and those money hungry agents. Don't get me wrong salary caps free agency and trade agreements were needed but the owners are still screwing over everybody and the league still lets them get away with chea........yeah yeah I know I said I was done.

  These last two will be quick and straight to the point

 4. Jerry Jones sells the team to the lowest bidder. Cause I'm just tired of looking at his face. Oh and he paid for the move of the Rams (Don't worry I hate their owner even more). He was also the only owner in the Superbowl era to fire the coach after winning the f ing Superbowl. Can anyone say he's as crazy as Al Davis was.

 5. Last and certainly not least. Could Roger the hypocrite Stokoe Goodell to vacate the office of commissioner of the NFL and take a long walk of a short pier.

jimmyhoffasbrother,Dallas Cowboys' options at center for the 2020 season,"Unfortunately for all of us fans, our beloved Fredbeard has retired, leaving a grown-ass-man-sized hole in both our hearts and the middle of the Cowboys' offensive line. Fortunately, all does not seem to be lost as we have a wealth of options available to fill the second of these holes.

#In-house replacements:

It seems that the most likely route will be slotting a player who is already on the roster in as the replacement starter. There are three clear candidates if the team goes this way.

**Joe Looney:** ""Jumbo"" Joe just re-signed with the Boys on a one-year, $2.4M contract. While he has filled various roles with the team since signing in 2016, he is most well-known as the guy who stepped in and started the whole season at center when Travis Frederick was diagnosed with Guillan-Barre syndrome in 2018. He filled the role admirably then and may be asked to do the same in 2020.

**Adam Redmond:** The Harvard grad has bounced around the league a bit in his early career, currently with his third team as he approaches his fifth season in the league. He was re-signed early in free agency on a modest one-year, $825K contract. He is certainly the dark-horse in this race, having entered the league as an UDFA and never started a game, but the old regime liked him enough to keep him on the roster despite dedicating a number of roster spots to the OL.

**Connor McGovern:** Now we come to the player that I would deem most likely to take over. McGovern essentially redshirted his rookie year due to a pectoral injury, but he was a much-hyped draft pick leading into offseason activities. McGovern was given a second-round grade by the previous regime during the 2019 draft but fell all the way to their third-round pick where the Cowboys felt he was too valuable to ignore despite IOL not being a position of need. At Penn State, McGovern started 14 games at center and 21 games at right guard. He was expected to compete with Connor Williams for the starting left guard position this offseason. But if the team wants to put the 5 best players on the field, it would seem wise to put both Connors on the field at the same time.

#Free agent options

Given the number of capable in-house options, free agency seems like an unlikely route for the Cowboys to go to fill the starting position. But just to be comprehensive, let's talk about it.

**Jon Halapio:** Halapio took a bit of a circuitous route to becoming an NFL starter. Drafted by the Patriots in 2014, the only playing time he got before 2017 was with the Boston Brawlers and the Brooklyn Bolts of the FXFL. He spent offseasons with the Patriots, Broncos, and Cardinals before finally landing with the Giants and starting for them in the 2017-2019 seasons. While he is a solid starting center, he comes with some serious injury concerns (broken leg, hamstring, Achilles) and does not represent a significant upgrade over Looney/McGovern.

#Draft options

This again seems like an unlikely route, but if one of the top prospects falls into their laps later than expected McGovern he did in 2019, it is a possibility worth considering.

**Lloyd Cushenberry, LSU:** Many draft analysts project Cushenberry as a guard in the NFL, but he played center at LSU and earned All-SEC honors in his final year with the team. Has all of the physical traits of an NFL center, but needs some work on his technique. Projected as a late second-round prospect.

**Cesar Ruiz, Michigan:** Ruiz started 25 games at center and 6 at guard while at Michigan. Like Looney and McGovern, he has the versatility to play any position on the interior. Similar to Cushenberry, he has all of the physical traits of an NFL center, but he also has a polish to his technique that would make him more of an immediate starting candidate. Projected as a second-round prospect.

Other options that I'm not going to write up but are worth considering:

* **Jonah Jackson, Ohio State** (4th round projection)

* **Tyler Biadasz, Wisconsin** (3rd round projection)

* **Matt Hennessy, Temple** (3rd round projection)","Dallas Cowboys' options at center for the 2020 season Unfortunately for all of us fans, our beloved Fredbeard has retired, leaving a grown-ass-man-sized hole in both our hearts and the middle of the Cowboys' offensive line.

The Cowboys have been a pretty good drafting team since 2012. But, this shows how short these windows can be of high draft picks on their original team. If you count Amari as a pseudo-1st rounder, only 50% of our 1st rounders still remain, and that's only if you count LVE will be able to bounce back strong this year. It's a pretty sobering reality, even if it's understood how short a shelf life the average NFL player has.","[Mosher] Cowboys First Round Picks since 2012: (Only Zack Martin, Zeke, and LVE remain) &gt; [\#Cowboys](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Cowboys?src=hashtag_click) first round picks since 2012:

MavsFanForLife,2014 Demarco Murray,"So because gamepass is now free, I’ve been rewatching a lot of 2014 highlights just because of how great and enjoyable that season was and I have to say.....man was Demarco a beast that year. I think people on this sub forget him too much at times because of the injury issues and how soon Zeke came after him, but I’ll take his 2014 season (minus all those fumbles) up against any season Zeke has had thus far in his career (although I’d still take Zeke as a player because of the consistency).

Also, that offense looked damn near unstoppable at times. Everyone was at their peak from romo to the offensive line to dez, Murray, Beasley and the other skill guys (even Dunbar had a solid role on that team on third downs). Hell, even the body catcher was good as a #2 WR. 

Damn, I miss that team. If only the defense was a bit better at that point in time (or the refs could call a catch correctly). We would’ve gone to Seattle and beaten them again.

Would we have beaten the Pats? Probably not because our defense couldn’t stop Brady, but damn I would’ve loved to see Romo and that offense go up against Bellichek.","2014 Demarco Murray So because gamepass is now free, I’ve been rewatching a lot of 2014 highlights just because of how great and enjoyable that season was and I have to say.....man was Demarco a beast that year.

As the OP pointed out there, the only QBs with 15,000+ passing yards in their first four seasons are Dak, Marino, Manning, and Tannehill.

I decided to see how they compared in terms of attempted passes and interceptions.

Both Manning and Tannehill had over 150 more pass attempts than Dak in the same amount of games. Marino clocks in with 21 less attempts but with 7 less games started.

Manning and Marino also racked up a shitload of INTs (Manning w/ 81 and Marino w/ 67.) Tannehill did a bit better than them with only 54 picks. 

Dak is currently standing at a very modest 36.

Not only has he kept pace with them in terms of yardage, he's done it with significantly less attempts and has been way safer with the ball in the process.","I did some math to give you guys more context in the ""15,000 passing yards over 4 seasons"" club I posted my comment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/cowboys/comments/fn1iki/15000_passing_yards_over_first_four_seasons/) but it's an old thread so I figured it could do with its own post.

This guy is on record of SO MANY TIMES having total and complete BULLSHIT come out of his mouth.

I mean its pretty easy to youtube his debates with Stephen A Smith during that time. Almost anytime he argues he ends up yelling, talking loud, supposedly thinking this is like a football lockerroom where all you have to do is use your mouth to get everybody all hyped up, and by doing so you win the argument. Its no surprise that he's one of the most religious guys out there, and that it looks like his church of choice is the Potter House where TD Jakes is boss. He's said so much stuff that sounds like what a black preacher would say. Enough of you guys out there should know what I mean.

But man I wish we could have Melvin Gordon on a 2 year $16 million deal instead.,"I really hope Zeke’s down season last year was due to the holdout, but it just doesn’t logically make sense since he trained at Cabo before other seasons too. He’s still elite, but nobody can deny that he’s overpaid for a RB in today’s league. Having a RB duo like Gordon and Pollard could save us money that could spent elsewhere.","I’m a huge Zeke fan.

swiper_no_swagger,I am going to say this one last time for the talking heads in the media.,"The reason Dak and the Cowboys haven’t agreed to a deal is because of the Contract Length. I’m looking at all of the sports talk shows that only talk about the average per year and the guaranteed amount of the Cowboys offer while bashing Dak when those numbers aren’t the main source of the dispute. The only mainstream reporter I’ve seen mention the contract length being the issue is Chris Mortensen. Even podcasts I respect, like Strong Opinion Sports have ignored this. It’s kind of frustrating.","I am going to say this one last time for the talking heads in the media. The reason Dak and the Cowboys haven’t agreed to a deal is because of the Contract Length.

Nolantheballer17,Wild Cowboys Super Bowl Plan,"Okay so here’s a wild theory of what the cowboys should do to get to the Super Bowl.

Step one: Trade Dak Prescott to the Redskins, for the second pick in the draft. Sure Dak is good but he wants to much money if we’re going to build a championship team now! 

Step 2 Draft Jerry Jeudy; a wide receiving corps of Amari Cooper, Michael Gallup, and Jerry Jeudy is unprecedented. Whoever is the next quarterback will have the greatest receiving group in the NFL with a great running back and a pretty solid o line. For all we know Jason Garret could go play QB and clap for 5000 yards

Step 3: Sign Jadeveon Clowney with the freed cap room. Damascus Lawrence, Clowney, and Gerald McCoy on the same Dline is terrifying and Carson Wentz would need emotional counseling. 

Step 4: Trade for a cheap Superman Cam Newton. Sure he’s had injury problems but now that he has had time to recover and with a fenomenal supporting staff, and a great coach in Mike McCarthy he could be comeback player of the year.

Step 5: Trade up in the draft and take a ballhawking safety or corner to replace Byron Jones and fill out the secondary.

Step 6: Super Bowl","Wild Cowboys Super Bowl Plan Okay so here’s a wild theory of what the cowboys should do to get to the Super Bowl.

Knowing that the cap will supposedly grow by upwards of $40million nxt year, we could afford his new deal.

mgrateful,Who should we target in Free Agency at this point if QB deal gets done,"Defensive linemen are a tough get because of the price of great inside ones and even average outside ones.  I think Shelby Harris brings more to the table at this point than McCoy and is worthy of a solid look.  Markus Golden was one of the best priced free agent grabs last year whom the Giants got 10 sacks out of and I have heard nothing about this year.   I think both these guys are worth a look at.

Chris Harris is the best cornerback left on the market.  He had some suspect breakdowns during this past season and I feel is going to cost too much in the long run.  He is obviously a hell of a talent but I want to see what Jourdan Lewis can do personally.  

The three safeties at the top of the list of remaining free agents are Vonn Bell, Haha Clinton Dix and Karl Joseph.  I don't know if I would want a long term deal with any of these guys but we let Heath (a starter go for 2 years worth up to 8 million) so what the plan is I am not sure.  I don't think we have the definite starter on the team at this point.  I doubt any of those safeties would sign for as low as Heath.  I didn't love Heath but a starter for several years let go that cheap they better have had a plan.

I am curious who you guys think would be good people to target.  I didn't include any offensive free agents as I doubt we should be spending much more on offense this year besides in the draft.  If maybe the market drops out for Robby Anderson or another speedster and we could get them super cheap thats a possibility but not really beyond that imho.  We need some backups for the offensive line obviously as well.","Who should we target in Free Agency at this point if QB deal gets done Defensive linemen are a tough get because of the price of great inside ones and even average outside ones.

I will not say we have no chance to be good because of course we do and anything can happen but things are as grim as they can get right now.

&amp;#x200B;

Two days into free agency we lost 4 defensive starters including our best cb, sack leader from last year and starters for multiple years at Safety and Defensive Line.  We also cannot even look to negotiate a deal with any free agents that we wanted from other teams until Dak stops holding the team hostage.  He is turning down contracts north of Goff by not responding for 2 weeks then responding with an ask north of Russell Wilson and 3 years max.  The team has dissolved around us because we couldn't negotiate with anyone else besides Amari and we will be a worse team for it.  I didn't even mention Witten.  The Cowboys used the tag on him its time to either give in or stop offering and let him play on it.  What is the point of paying a RB, WR, QB 30+ percent of your entire cap when you cannot field a competitive team around them.  These negotiations have decidedly lowered the Cowboys chances at playing meaningful games.  We are losing all these players and we still don't have our QB locked up this is ridiculous.","To everyone who said I was crazy that Dak was holding us hostage and it was time to let him walk if he wanted more than 35 million.....

Hugh_Jankles,Theoretical: Signing Tom Brady &amp; Trading Dak Prescott?,"This was discussed a month or so ago about ""serious discussions"" that took place internally over at Cowboys HQ. &amp; at the time it seemed a bit far fetched since New England was the favorite to resign him &amp; would he really leave talk. 

Now that he is officially leaving &amp; some teams that were in the mix like Indy &amp; Tennessee are out of the running as well as San Francisco, Cowboys could potentially get Brady at a decent deal if it's not just about money with Tom &amp; more about winning within 1 to 2 years. 

The have an offense with solid weapons &amp; a top offensive line. Theoretically, what if we reach out to the Dolphins &amp; say we'd swap 1st with them &amp; give them Dak in order to sign Brady &amp; draft a QB, Presumably Tua, with the 5th overall pick? 

I personally feel like this contingency is cheaper than signing Dak for 4 years at over $140, with $110mil guaranteed. You get, let's say, Brady at 2 years $50mil &amp; then Tua with a rookie contract at 5 years $30-$32mil. The Cowboys would save roughly $30 million over 5 years, have Brady with Amare &amp; Elliott &amp; the O-Line. &amp; still have some money to sign a FA instead of worrying about getting Dak $35-$40mil a year. 

I know I'll probably be flamed but I'm just generally curious about the thoughts on this board. It seems like a good portion of the base agrees that paying Dak $40mil a year is quite a bit overpay but also people don't want to go into QB hell. I don't think Brady is what he use to be but I do think he's a completely capable QB to get you into the playoffs. &amp; he'd arguably have better weapons &amp; line this year than he did with New England last year, who despite it all, still went 12-4.","Theoretical: Signing Tom Brady &amp; Trading Dak Prescott?

OKSportsTakes,Dallas botched the offseason,"Lifelong Cowboys fan here, watched about 95% of games since the 2008 season. I loved what Dallas did last offseason and heading into the regular season. Signed all the fire players other than Dak, but in September and after those 3 games, I believed his contract extension would be an afterthought. 

Dak Prescott, Amari Cooper, Byron Jones

3 big time free agents who all deserve to get paid but Jerry made the wrong decision for all of them. Dak should have been signed, Jones franchise tagged and Cooper let go. Yep let go of the receiver we paid a 1st round pick for. IMO Gallup is going to blow up. He’s a legit No. 1 WR. And with the incoming class of WRs in the draft Dallas could have snagged somebody. 

Then, a lockdown corner is what Dallas has needed for so long. Ever since that guy broke the world record at the combine I believed in him and now they let him go. Franchise tag him. Would he play or hold out? I think that’s his decision to make. 

Sign Dak to the contract he has earned and deserved. I think the past few days changed trajectory of Dallas for the next couple years cause Dak is gone after his coming one.","Dallas botched the offseason Lifelong Cowboys fan here, watched about 95% of games since the 2008 season.

I like Dak and think moving forward he should be the quarter back however ownership seems to playing games and using chicanary to pit it like Dak is asking for the moon and the stars however this is all speculation. We don't know what the truth is we know some facts but not the truth. The Tennessee Titans QB Ryan tannenhill contract should point out that the cowboys fans the hipocracy. Tannenhill has a wr turn QB and the racialism is there were because the mentality of some people is to presume  that you can transfer him into a QB because he'll pick it up and with someone like Lamar Jackson make him a wr because the NFL style will be too hard for him to pick up there is already a slant. However we all saw how Derek Henry literally carried the titans to the playoffs and to the afcc game. Yet because he basically played half a good season he got payed like hes Nick foles and he won the Superbowl against Tom Brady. 
The thing that erks me the most is the way Jerry as acts like the 90s cowboys are his brain child and that he made that team go but besides going down the road of how the cowboys ruined thier chance at three peating and otherwise. The cowboys also lost a first round pick because Jerry tried to sign a wide receiver when told not to do that because the NFL didn't have a new Cap. He wanted to pick Johnny I'm strung out on drugs football until his son stopped him. He overpaid for Eziekel Elliot. He didn't recruit Tony Romo.  Jerry got ride of the three best coaches Dallas ever had, yet he held onto one of the top three canidates for the worst coach behind Marvin Lewis and Jeff Fisher. He brought back a Jason witten who was a net negative against the cowboys last year.  He does and has done all this yet he moves the goal post for Dak. Dak wanted to sign before the season and he played out the season injured and banged up unlike that idiot teamate of his that held out who will not live up the contract.

ThePlural,Yall are stressing me out,"TLDR;  You all trippin for nothing, we were never keeping them all, and I dont like coop anyway 

The team is going to be fine. We have a brand new Coaching staff that is looking for players to fit its scheme, and plenty of money to do some damage shopping FAs. 

Cooper, Byran and Dak are all looking to be the highest paid at their positions and signing deals like that just doesnt seem like a viable winning strategy to me. It's not uncommon for Coop disappear and his desire to win seems questionable to me. Byron is replaceable. While Dak is one of the most difficult contracts to get done for any team this year, we still have plenty of time to get him set up with a deal.

After going 8-8 and underperforming wouldn't you want some significant change?","Yall are stressing me out TLDR;  You all trippin for nothing, we were never keeping them all, and I dont like coop anyway

02grimreaper,The big problem with the Cowboys’ interest in free agents,"My opinion, feel free to ream me if you feel I am way off-base. But here it is: if the cowboys are interested in high profile free agents (Chris Harris) that other teams are interested in, they haven’t been able to land said free agent the past few years. Instead I read a story about how the cowboys have interest, and then next thing I know that free agent is signing with another team. 

I understand they are trying to be frugal and not go all out in free agency like they did in past years, but sometimes you are gonna have to pay for quality. We got lucky last year we got Quinn in a trade. 

We have a lot of irons in the fire, but I do hope they get at least a couple decent free agents to fill some of these huge holes we have on the team.

enaur,If the Cowboys don't re-sign Amari Cooper the trade value is atrocious.,"Reminder that we traded a 1st for Amari about halfway into the 2018 season. I didn't like the trade at the time, but the addition of Cooper to our roster really did improve us greatly as a team. I reasoned with myself that if we were able to sign him long term and he kept up his production the trade could be justified.

However, at this point we got 1.5 years of a solid #1 WR for our first round pick in 2019. If Amari isn't a Cowboy for at least another 3-4 years this is one of the worst value trades the Cowboys have ever made. Even the Roy Williams trade will seemingly have more value than this. 

Anyone who tries to rationalize that the addition of Cooper made us better for 1.5 years is truly delusional. Essentially, at this point, we traded an incredibly valuable future asset for almost nothing gained. Were the few wins that Amari gave us worth it? I think not.","If the Cowboys don't re-sign Amari Cooper the trade value is atrocious. Reminder that we traded a 1st for Amari about halfway into the 2018 season.

mgrateful,Who actually wants the Cowboys to sign Dez and why? I can't see it being anything but bad news.,"The Cowboys need to move on from the past.  It's long past time.  We finally got rid of the red-headed blunder child we don't need to rehash other oldies but way past their primies.  Witten needs to move on and Dez definitely needs not to be giving a second look.  

What positives could there be to bringing Dez back to the Cowboys.  He pissed and moaned and talked nothing but crap about the Cowboys after he was sent packing.  He has never been anything but immature and he has no game left.  Why is this even being entertained at this point?  He will try to dominate conversations, he will force himself into a leadership role that is way undeserved and he will rub the current leaders the wrong way.  He will never agree to being a bit player on or off the field at least not in Dallas.  He 5 years removed from being the great WR he was.  In 2017 the last time he played a game in the NFL in 16 games he had 69 catches on 132 targets for 838 yards.  That was with us forcing him the ball and him creating no separation.  He hasn't played since that year at all besides 1 practice with the Saints.  What could he possibly bring to the table besides distraction and strife.  I wouldn't sign him for 1 dollar as he has no place on the field in our lineup and definitely no place in our locker room.  The final thing I will say is why saddle McCarthy with this ego in his first year.  We need to move forward not back.","Who actually wants the Cowboys to sign Dez and why? I can't see it being anything but bad news. The Cowboys need to move on from the past.  It's long past time.  We finally got rid of the red-headed blunder child we don't need to rehash other oldies but way past their primies.  Witten needs to move on and Dez definitely needs not to be giving a second look.  

What positives could there be to bringing Dez back to the Cowboys.  He pissed and moaned and talked nothing but crap about the Cowboys after he was sent packing.  He has never been anything but immature and he has no game left.  Why is this even being entertained at this point?  He will try to dominate conversations, he will force himself into a leadership role that is way undeserved and he will rub the current leaders the wrong way.  He will never agree to being a bit player on or off the field at least not in Dallas.  He 5 years removed from being the great WR he was.  In 2017 the last time he played a game in the NFL in 16 games he had 69 catches on 132 targets for 838 yards.  That was with us forcing him the ball and him creating no separation.  He hasn't played since that year at all besides 1 practice with the Saints.  What could he possibly bring to the table besides distraction and strife.  I wouldn't sign him for 1 dollar as he has no place on the field in our lineup and definitely no place in our locker room.  The final thing I will say is why saddle McCarthy with this ego in his first year.  We need to move forward not back.",1

Zsambi,Interactive community mock,"Have a good morning y'all!

&amp;#x200B;

I am a first time poster here on the Cowboys' subreddit, but I am hopeful that the content will be something to hold on to until the prime F5 season in less than 2 weeks!!!!

&amp;#x200B;

Over at r/NFL_Draft there was a guy, who started to organize an interactive offseason + mock draft a month ago. Every team had atleast 1 person, in some cases 2 as their primary and secondary GMs. They were responsible for the teams that they picked. I am originally a Broncos fan, but nobody wanted to take the Boys, so I volunteered for it. I spent some hours to study your scheme, needs, contracts etc.

We started with the Free Agency, which had the following rules:

 \-No restructures

 \-You could weight the cap hits. In the case of 2 year deals, you could weight your hit by 20% towards either year if the other year made it equal. In case of 3 year deals, you could weight your cap hit by 30% either year, but at the end the average had to be the same, like it would've been with the AAV.

&amp;#x200B;

Here are the moves I made:

Cuts: I have cut Crawford and Fleming.

After these moves I had  approximately 89 million in cap sapce which I spent on these players:

Internal signings:

 1. Signing Dak Prescott to a 5 year 170 million deal which included 115 million guaranteed. First year cap hit would be 25 million.

 2. Signing Amari Cooper to a 3 year 54 million deal which included 35 million guaranteed. First year cap hit would be 15 million.

 3. Signing Anthony Brown to a 4 year 20 million deal which included 12 million guaranteed. First year cap hit would be 4 million.

 4. Signing Darian Thompson to a 3 year 4,5 million deal which included 2,5 million guaranteed. First year cap hit would be 1,5 million.

 5. Signing Kerry Hyder to a 1 year 2 million deal which included 1 million guaranteed. First year cap hit would be 2 million.

 6. Signing Joe Thomas to a 2 year 3,5 million deal which included 2 million guaranteed. First year cap hit would be 1,5 million.

 7. Signing Kai Forbath to a 2 year 2 million deal which included 1 million guaranteed. First year cap hit would be 1 million.

 8. Signing ERFAs Antwuan Woods and Alex Redmond.

External signings:

1. TE Austin Hooper 5 years 48 million, 30 guaranteed. 2020 hit: 8,5M
2. DT Adam Butler 4 years 27 million, 15 guaranteed. 2020 hit: 6,5 M
3. WR Pharoh Cooper 3 years 7 million, 4 guaranteed. 2020 hit: 2 M
4. S Will Parks 4 years 16 million, 10 guaranteed. 2020 cap hit: 3,5 M
5.  TE Nick O'Leary 1 year 1,5 million, 0,5 guaranteed. 2020 cap hit: 1,5 M
6.  LB Kevin Pierre Louis 3 years 12 million, 7 guaranteed. 2020 cap hit: 4 M
7. EDGE Trent Murphy 1 year 4 million, 2,5 guaranteed. 2020 cap hit: 4 M
8. DT Zach Kerr 3 year 5 million, 2 guaranteed. 2020 cap hit: 1,5 M
9. LS Zach Wood 3 years 2,25 million, 1,5 guaranteed. 2020 cap hit: 0,75 M

I have tagged and traded Byron Jones to the Las Vegas Raiders for #81 overall pick. (Mid 3rd)

Butler: Tough, hard-working guy went from udnrafted to play the 2nd most snaps on the Patriots' defensive line. He is versatile, could play 3-4 5tech or 4-3 3 tech, but his breakout season came in that 5tech role. He is a better pass rusher than run defender, but I feel comfortable with the personnel around him, he could be a very valuable asset, who could also serve as a mentor to Trysten Hill.

Hooper:  I don't think it needs more explanation. Best TE on the market with B- blocking and A- receiving talent.

P. Cooper: PR and KR experience. Solid #3 #4 WR for peanuts. This is the kind of signing that could make a difference.

Parks: Since I am a Broncos fan, I know this guy well. That's why I am probably higher on him than most of you. He is an A+ guy on and off the field too. His versatility is his calling card as he logged snaps from SS, FS, Slot CB, Dime LB. He is a tough guy with good instincts but his athleticism is only average. Special teams ace.

O'Leary: Safety net. Good blocker, veteran.

Pierre-Louis: He shined during the Bears last several games. Very good athletic ability and cover skills. As the 3rd linebacker on the weakside, I like his potential a lot. Also a special teams standout.

Murphy: Solid run defender, with solid pass rushing abilities. Not a flashy player, but for 4 million / year his services are more than welcomed. He had 5 sacks last year while playing only 65 % of the snaps. Also 2 FF.

Kerr: Solid run defender. Big guy with 330 lbs. Has some pass rushing ability too. Good locker room presence. 

Wood: He is a long snapper. Well yeah, that's all. One thing is sure: He is yougner than Muhlbach.

Draft:

\#21: CB CJ Henderson. 

I have traded #17 for #21 and #85. It was a bit bitter sweet trade, since I had to make it with the Eagles and I would throw up in my mouth if I had to trade with the Raiders, but once all the guys were gone I was eyeing (Kinlaw, Chaisson) I decided to move back some spots since I was comfortable with (in order) Henderson, Fulton, Delpit. Fortunately my 1A pick remained on the board and I ran to the podium with it.

\#51: S Antoine Winfield Jr.

Yeah, this was a tough one. I was thorn between Winfield and Davis. After all WInfield's versatility was the deciding factor. I believe versatility is very huge in today's NFL, that's why I tried to acquire guys who can play in both 4-3 and 3-4 fronts and S / CB / LB. Winfield fits this latter description so I went with him. Will Parks plays kind of a similar role, but Parks' can also play slot CB in nickel at a very good level just like LB in dime or safety in base.

\#81: DT Davon Hamilton

My favorite pick. Really, this guy could give an extreme boost to that defensive line. Versatile, could play Nose, 1T, 3T or even some 5T. Nolan for sure would like a guy of his caliber. 6'4"" 320+ mammoth.

\#82 EDGE Darrell Taylor

I was targeting Chaisson in the first, since DLaw is quite injury prone and someone offered Quinn more than 13,5 M / year, which I wasn't willing to. My plan B was Murphy who I managed to sign to a fair deal, but he's only on a short 1 year deal, and he's not a superstar by any means. I also hold out hope that Armstrong could become someone, but he's still unproven. EDGE became a priority because of this cloudy situation and I felt really good about Taylor. He's also versatile, which is a plus for Nolan's defense. Has experience rushing the passer from 2 and 3 point stances, has coverage drops (zone and even man!!). Quite good run defender with upside as a pass rusher.

\#85 WR / TE Chase Claypool

This pick came down to 4 players. Jordyn Brooks, Hakeem Adeniji, Claypool and Adam Trautman. The deciding factor was that I felt the need for a pass catcher tight end and for a backup WR who could become eventually a starter. This is what Claypool was made for. Hooper is a solid blocker and receiver. O'Leary is only a blocker and we don't know much about Schultz but seems like he is far superior blocker than receiving threat. If something happens to Hooper, this group would be really bad. Enter Claypool, who could serve as a smaller TE, with some second level blocking ability. I thought that I hit 2 birds with this one stone, even if those birds were not that big.

The whole thing concluded here, we stopped after round 3. My main target for the 4th was Adeniji to serve as a swing tackle option with starter upside either inside or outside.

Okay lads and lasses. Tear this apart!

Have a nice day!

Cheers, David.","Interactive community mock Have a good morning y'all!

&amp;#x200B;

I am a first time poster here on the Cowboys' subreddit, but I am hopeful that the content will be something to hold on to until the prime F5 season in less than 2 weeks!!!!

&amp;#x200B;

Over at r/NFL_Draft there was a guy, who started to organize an interactive offseason + mock draft a month ago. Every team had atleast 1 person, in some cases 2 as their primary and secondary GMs. They were responsible for the teams that they picked. I am originally a Broncos fan, but nobody wanted to take the Boys, so I volunteered for it. I spent some hours to study your scheme, needs, contracts etc.

We started with the Free Agency, which had the following rules:

 \-No restructures

 \-You could weight the cap hits. In the case of 2 year deals, you could weight your hit by 20% towards either year if the other year made it equal. In case of 3 year deals, you could weight your cap hit by 30% either year, but at the end the average had to be the same, like it would've been with the AAV.

&amp;#x200B;

Here are the moves I made:

Cuts: I have cut Crawford and Fleming.

After these moves I had  approximately 89 million in cap sapce which I spent on these players:

Internal signings:

 1. Signing Dak Prescott to a 5 year 170 million deal which included 115 million guaranteed. First year cap hit would be 25 million.

 2. Signing Amari Cooper to a 3 year 54 million deal which included 35 million guaranteed. First year cap hit would be 15 million.

 3. Signing Anthony Brown to a 4 year 20 million deal which included 12 million guaranteed. First year cap hit would be 4 million.

 4. Signing Darian Thompson to a 3 year 4,5 million deal which included 2,5 million guaranteed. First year cap hit would be 1,5 million.

 5. Signing Kerry Hyder to a 1 year 2 million deal which included 1 million guaranteed. First year cap hit would be 2 million.

 6. Signing Joe Thomas to a 2 year 3,5 million deal which included 2 million guaranteed. First year cap hit would be 1,5 million.

 7. Signing Kai Forbath to a 2 year 2 million deal which included 1 million guaranteed. First year cap hit would be 1 million.

 8. Signing ERFAs Antwuan Woods and Alex Redmond.

External signings:

1. TE Austin Hooper 5 years 48 million, 30 guaranteed. 2020 hit: 8,5M
2. DT Adam Butler 4 years 27 million, 15 guaranteed. 2020 hit: 6,5 M
3. WR Pharoh Cooper 3 years 7 million, 4 guaranteed. 2020 hit: 2 M
4. S Will Parks 4 years 16 million, 10 guaranteed. 2020 cap hit: 3,5 M
5.  TE Nick O'Leary 1 year 1,5 million, 0,5 guaranteed. 2020 cap hit: 1,5 M
6.  LB Kevin Pierre Louis 3 years 12 million, 7 guaranteed. 2020 cap hit: 4 M
7. EDGE Trent Murphy 1 year 4 million, 2,5 guaranteed. 2020 cap hit: 4 M
8. DT Zach Kerr 3 year 5 million, 2 guaranteed. 2020 cap hit: 1,5 M
9. LS Zach Wood 3 years 2,25 million, 1,5 guaranteed. 2020 cap hit: 0,75 M

pot8odragon,No team has had success after making their QB the highest or top paid. What makes you so sure Dak and the Cowboys won’t be in the same boat.,"Here are the NFLs highest paid Qbs: 

NFL's highest paid quarterbacks (average salary per year):
1. Seahawks QB Russell Wilson: $35 million
2. Steelers QB Ben Roethlisberger: $34 million
3.Packers QB Aaron Rodgers: $33.5 million
3. Rams QB Jared Goff: $33.5 million
5. Eagles QB Carson Wentz: $32 million
6. Falcons QB Matt Ryan: $30 million

8. Colts QB Jacoby Brissett: $27.98 million
9. 49ers QB Jimmy Garoppolo: $27.5 million
10. Lions QB Matthew Stafford: $27 million

Most of these teams have massive holes that either keep them from getting to the playoffs or making solid runs at the playoffs. 

Only a few of these teams have even made it past the divisional round in the playoffs. 

Only two of these teams have made a super bowl! One of which made it before they paid their qb, the other was carried by a great running game and defense. That team was San Francisco which benefited from a horrible last two seasons. 

My question, what makes you think with our roster, our depleted defense and making dak the highest paid qb in the league we have a real chance of winning a Super Bowl? 

Generally curious. Would love to hear constructive ideas","No team has had success after making their QB the highest or top paid. What makes you so sure Dak and the Cowboys won’t be in the same boat. Here are the NFLs highest paid Qbs:

ElizabethAnnWashingt,So according to 105.3 WFAN the deadline to vote on the new CBA is 4 hours before the deadline to use both the franchise and transition tags,"for those who may not understand the reason the Dallas Cowboys can use both the franchise tag and the transition tag this year is because it is the last year of the current CBA.

If the new CBA is approved it is possible that that technicality disappears and Dallas can only use the franchise tag.

If this happens it would likely mean Dak Prescott gets one of the versions of the franchise tag and Amari Cooper and Byron Jones both become completely unrestricted free agents","So according to 105.3 WFAN the deadline to vote on the new CBA is 4 hours before the deadline to use both the franchise and transition tags for those who may not understand the reason the Dallas Cowboys can use both the franchise tag and the transition tag this year is because it is the last year of the current CBA.

joegtech,Mims - Maclin Comp,"Mims reminds me a little of Jeremy Maclin.   Unlike Agholor, there seems to be a toughness, a hard-working, US ""Heartland"" mentality.  

Maclin was drafted at #19 after the Eagles traded up. 

I expected their spider charts to be similar, but I was very surprised. 

 [https://www.mockdraftable.com/player/denzel-mims](https://www.mockdraftable.com/player/denzel-mims) 

 [https://www.mockdraftable.com/player/jeremy-maclin](https://www.mockdraftable.com/player/jeremy-maclin) 

Maclin was a very productive WR for the Eagles, although no doubt was helped by the presence of DJax and Shady.   I recall a number of Maclin's tough catches over the middle resulting in collisions with a Safety.   Mims says he likes to run routes over the middle. 

Based on the spider chart it seems Mim's upside potential is higher than Maclin's was coming out of school.   

However Mim's does not have experience in a sophisticated passing attack.   I'd expect Mims to take longer to integrate into a team's offense, especially in a very strange year.   I expect those factors to affect Mim's draft slot. 

I'm fine with Jefferson or Mims at 21 although Mims is a better fit for their current need at outside WR.

I'm less excited about Reagor and Hamler because, unlike DJax, there are questions about the reliability of their hands.   Even so I think the Eagles underneath receivers will benefit from the threat of the speed of Reagor and Hamler. 

Barring something REALLY strange the Eagles will come away with a WR in rounds 1 or 2 who will help them this season and beyond.","Mims - Maclin Comp Mims reminds me a little of Jeremy Maclin.   Unlike Agholor, there seems to be a toughness, a hard-working, US ""Heartland"" mentality.

SuboptimalSpider-Man,Lucky pick 53,"I know that a lot of the focus right now is on who we’ll be drafting with our first rounder (I’d say 21, but I’m hoping we trade up), but I’m more interested in pick 53. Why am I more interested in a mid-late round two pick? Because it’s a lucky number for us. 

The past two times we’ve had pick 53 in the draft, we’ve drafted great players. LeSean McCoy with one in 2009 and Miles Sanders with one in 2019. This track record begs the natural question: who are we getting this year?

I personally like a power back, seeing as the other two picks at 53 have been RBs and they worked out pretty well.

SaricGetsNoCalls,Smokescreen Season!,"The draft is nearly upon us. And as it approaches, the BS reports sky rocket. And I’ve heard a THOUSAND times that many reports could be “smokescreens”. In other words, it could just be a GM getting the word out and pretending to like one player so another player can slip and fall to them (or other reasons).

Is this actually reality? Why would any team buy any sort of public report? Why would a GM leak something as a “smokescreen”? If you claim to be a smart person, you wouldn’t read into these leaks even one bit. 

And therefore, I don’t think any GMs give a flying truck about these reports. We’re all just being played like a fiddle. There aren’t “smokescreens”.

Peteygeebs,2020 Eagles Secondary Outlook,"Entering 2020 free agency, the Eagles had obvious needs in the secondary and GM Howie Roseman seems to have filled the void.  The 2019 secondary were mediocre at best and it looks like Roseman viewed change to be necessary.  

While the birds did lose defensive leader and franchise great Malcolm Jenkins to the New Orleans Saints, they were able to retain his partner at safety, Rodney McLeod on an affordable 2-year deal.  McLeod logged 76 combined tackles, 2 interceptions, and 2 forced fumbles for the Eagles in 2019. 

CB Jalen Mills was also signed back on a 1-year deal worth up to $5 million, and is likely heading towards a change to safety.  Injured for the majority of the last 2 seasons, Mills looks to come into the season healthy and ready to roll.  In 9 regular season games last season, Mills combined for 41 tackles and 1 interception. The transition to safety could pay off, as many think that is his more natural position.

Philly native,  S Will Parks enters on another 1-year deal from the Denver Broncos and should be a versatile depth player who can play safety, nickel corner, and even some linebacker.  

CB Nickell Robey-Coleman, most recently on the LA Rams was another bargain acquisition, coming over on a 1-year $1 million deal. Robey-Coleman, most infamously known for the blatant Pass Interference in the 2018 NFC Championship game against the Saints, is one of the better nickel cornerbacks in the NFL and should provide some consistency from that position.  

And finally, the biggest splash the Eagles made in the secondary was the trade for CB Darius Slay of the Detroit Lions. It seemed like a long time coming as the Eagles have been rumored to be chasing a trade for Slay at the trade deadline.  Slay instantly gives the Eagles a chance to lockdown number 1 WR’s of opponents, which they have not been able to do in a long time.   In shadow coverage on NFC East counterpart Amari Cooper in a 2019 matchup, Slay gave Cooper trouble, allowing only 3 catches for 38 yards.  
	
There are still several other players remaining on the depth chart that will compete for starting spots and back end roster spots.  Avonte Maddox returns and looks to take over the CB2 spot.  Competing with him for that spot will be Sydney Jones, who displayed flashes of what fans hoped he would be last season.  Still inconsistent, he will need to prove his worth if he wants to receive dependable on field snaps.  Cre’Von LeBlanc will compete with Nickell Robey-Coleman in the slot.  On the back end of the depth chart and competing for roster spots will be Rasul Douglas, Trevor Williams, Marcus Epps, and presumably a rookie or two.  
	
It does not seem like overall depth will not be an issue, however with the Eagles injury luck, the talent of this depth chart is what will be tested like years past.

neuron_recall,Where do you see Boston Scott fitting into the 2020 roster?,"In 2019, Boston Scott took snaps in the last 11 games of the regular season and the Wild Card game. Scott was a starting player for only 2 of those games (Week 11 vs NWE, Week 14 vs NYG). In those 12 games:

\&gt;Scott averaged only \~5.5 offensive snaps per game (38 total over 7 weeks) in Weeks 6-13, but he only played special teams in 3 out of 7 of those games. (One of those 3 games he technically took 3 offensive snaps, but he rushed for 0 attempts and 0 yards). In this stretch, Scott rushed for 94 yards on 23 attempts, good for just over 4 yards per carry. His only reception went for 5 yards, and his only touchdown was a 4 yard rush Week 4 @ BUF.

\&gt;Starting with Week 14, however, he averaged 37 offensive snaps per game (148 over 4 weeks) to end out the regular season. In this stretch, Scott rushed for 151 yards on 38 attempts, good for just under 4 yards per carry. In the passing game, Scott caught 23 passes for 199 yards, good for 8.65 yards per catch. Scott had 4 touchdowns in the last 4 games, including a 3 TD game in the last game of the regular season.

\&gt;Scott only had more than 10 rushing attempts in 1 game (Week 17 @ NYG) all season. In that Week 17 match-up, Scott had 19 carries for 54 yards and 3 touchdowns.

\&gt;Amusingly, Scott and Carson Wentz had nearly identical rushing attempts and rushing yards throughout 2019 (Wentz had 62 attempts for 243 yards, Scott had 61 attempts for 245 yards)

Do you see Boston Scott staying with the Eagles going forwards in 2020 and beyond, or do you think he had his time to shine and now it's time to get out of the way for a now-healthy Miles Sanders? Personally I think he's great to keep around on the team. Either he becomes a good RB2 to take relief snaps or he boosts his worth to other teams and the Eagles are able to get some draft capital to fill out depth.

Projected 3rd to 4th round pick but I wouldn't even mind if we took him in the second.

2019 stats:  83 tackles, 12.5 tackles for loss, 8.0sacks, five pass breakups, one forced fumble and an interception 

Probably the game that caught my eye the most was vs LSU, he sacked burrow twice, total of 8 tackles with two tackles for a loss. 2019 LSU is the most pro level offense you're gonna get in college and he balled against them.

The biggest concern for him is injuries, he had a knee injury in 2018 which he required surgery on.

other mid-round LBS ive been intruiged by is Troy Dye of Oregon and Malik Harrison of Ohio State

if we were to use 21 on a linebacker id like Patrick Queen, K'lavon Chassion or Kenneth Murray.

cusephenom,Trading up for WR... the conundrum,"Jenny Vrentas recently posted [her NFL mock draft](https://www.si.com/nfl/2020/04/14/nfl-mock-draft-chargers-trade-ahead-dolphins-bucs-eagles-trade-up?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=themmqb).

It has the Eagles trading up a few spots to select... Justin Jefferson.

I hate that idea. I hate the idea that we would trade up for the 4th rated WR in the draft. You can't waste draft capital for the 4th best player at a position. If the top 3 are gone and Jefferson makes it to 21, maybe you take him. Maybe (I'm not quite sold on him).

BUT!!! If one of the other big 3 (especially Ruggs... I love Ruggs) slip past Denver at 15, we have to seriously consider moving up.

It's a tough balancing act. Perhaps I value these receivers differently than you do or differently than the Eagles do. Bottom line: I hate the idea of trading up for the 4th rated WR.","Trading up for WR... the conundrum Jenny Vrentas recently posted [her NFL mock draft](https://www.si.com/nfl/2020/04/14/nfl-mock-draft-chargers-trade-ahead-dolphins-bucs-eagles-trade-up?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=themmqb).

BCSinReverse,"If the Eagles draft the WR in the 1st round that you are hoping they draft, how do you then see the team doing this season?","Going into the draft as the team stands now I think they are around a 9-7 football team.  They added some talent for sure at DT and CB but it does feel like this defense has made its most significant changes since the first year of the Schwartz era.  It will be interesting and exciting to see how it plays out but I'm not necessarily considering it written in stone that the defense is noticeably better than last year.  


On offense I'd be extremely worried and down if this was what the Eagles were entering the season with at WR.  Thankfully no matter what happens in the draft they will no doubt leave it with at least one WR.  Hopefully at least two but for sure at least one.  


I have a few guys I really like for the Eagles first round pick if they move up or stay where they are.  If the Eagles actually get one of the WRs I like in the first round then I feel like it will elevate my expectations for this team form 9-7 to maybe 11-5.

davidfridolphjr,"Justin Jefferson, Future Eagle, Future All-Pro, Future Hindsight-No Doubter.","Sorry guys if something like this has been posted but...

Every year there's a guy who kills it in the NFL-- becomes Probowl/All-pro and so then you look back and see that they weren't drafted ridiculously high but you watch their college tape and they dominated. And so you sit and wonder why the hell he slipped through the cracks... and it almost *always* comes down over analyzing a player for the sake of ""dRaFt vALuE.""

And yes it's easy to watch someone like Michael Thomas' college tape now IN HINDSIGHT and see how dominant he was at Ohio State and see how it was bound to translate to the NFL. It's easy now because it happened. We now know.

And I just feel like that's what is happening with Justin Jefferson. And again it's all because of this draft value over-analysis BS. 

*""He hasn't proven he can do all that from X or Z or against press coverage.""*

*""Or he's good at a lot of things but great at nothing.""*

 This dude killed the regular season, caught everything (best percentage on contested catches by 30%), was in the top tier in forcing missed tackles (10 more than Mr. Quick Feet Jeudy), consistently made big plays, had clutch hands, showed up HUGE in big games, killed the combine, and was a constant all season, looked every bit of an elite prospect, but yet some people act like he has a limited ceiling and is ""not worth the 21st pick.""

People, fans, experts, whoever are all so enamored by rankings and ""draft value"" that people are looking at Jefferson at 21 and comparing that with getting a draft value superstar like Jeudy at 14 and it just looks and feels like a bad pick because of ""value"". And trust me I have zero problem if you have Justin Jefferson ranked as the best WR or the 12th best or if to you think ""he's not worth the 21st pick""... because that's what makes this fun. I hope you all have that player you feel strongly about drafting. 

But just know... **Justin Jefferson's ability to adjust his hands, eyes, and feet to the ball regardless of where he is or how off-balanced he is... is special. It's arguably the best in this historic class**. And just don't be surprised if he becomes just another misvalued Michael Thomas. Because I think if he gets on the right team it is likely to happen.","Justin Jefferson, Future Eagle, Future All-Pro, Future Hindsight-No Doubter.

GhostfacedPacifist,Trade our first away?,"So... we trade our first-round pick away this year. If the top three are taken, we pull the trigger and trade our first to the Lions for a second and their next-year first.

* Deep WR class, we can get one of the second-tier receivers early in the second round, using our remaining second-round pick to draft an LB
* We use the Lion's probable first pick next year to draft Ja'Marr Chase
* We get to watch another game every week! (to see whether the Lions lose or not)

**Cons:**

* One hell of a gamble (maybe not because Patricia is Patricia)
* Could leave Carson W/O any good wide receivers for another year
* We might not be getting enough in the trade 

I'm kinda going dummy in this quarantine, so this might be stupid af, but it seems like a gamble that might be worth taking.","Trade our first away?

I personally think that I'd rather have Sanders for the Eagles than Jacobs. Jacobs showed some receiving skills at Bama, but had only 20 catches all year, whereas Sanders' receiving skills were a question mark coming out of PSU, but he obviously squashed any of those concerns.

UnluckyDoctor23,Warming not to the idea of NOT drafting a receiver in the first round,"Admittedly I was somewhat rigid on the idea that we needed to draft a receiver in the 1st round.

Example: You’re able to trade a few spots back in the first round and pick one of: Grant Delpit, Kenneth Murray, Patrick Queen, Yetur Gross-Matos. Then, use your trade back ammo to move up from pick 53 to draft one of: Aiyuk, Reagor, Mims, Shenault (depending on who is there).

eaglesnation11,Creating a 53 Man Roster of Former Eagles in 2020,"QB: Nick Foles, Matt Barkley, Chase Daniel

QB depth is actually pretty good here. Foles be a mid to bottom tier starter, but obviously we’ve seen he can keep the team afloat. Matt Barkley and Chase Daniel have both proven to be solid backup QBs. This would be a solid QB room

RB: Jordan Howard, Raheem Mostert, LeSean McCoy, Dion Lewis, Kenjon Barner

This is a hell of a RBBC. Howard is still a very good power back and we an extremely talented change of pace back in Mostert. McCoy would back up Howard as RB on the first two downs and Dion Lewis would be a solid backup 3DRB. Kenjon Barner is a great guy to return kicks.

WR: Golden Tate, Danny Amendola, Nelson Agholor,  Jordan Matthews, Marcus Johnson, Mack Hollins

Golden Tate still can get it done especially in the slot. The aging Danny Amendola still showed tremendous flash as he totaled over 600 receiving yards last year with nothing at QB. Jordan Matthews and Nelson Agholor are controversial figures in this town, but they still are NFL caliber WRs and I still believe Agholor could be a very good WR3 for a team. Marcus Johnson is a capable WR as he totaled about 200 yards for Indy last year. While Hollins sucks as a WR he can still cover ground as a gunner so we have him here.

TE: Trey Burton, Richard Rodgers, Eric Tomlinson

Trey Burton may have had a decline since leaving Philly, but in my opinion with the right offense and QB he can still be a clear cut TE1 in the league. Dick Rod’s time in Philly may have been short, but he still has really good hands for a Tight End. Eric Tomlinson isn’t that skilled of a pass catcher, but at 6’6 265 he would be a mammoth in blocking.

OL: Jason Peters, Chance Warmack, Stefan Wisniewski, Dennis Kelly, Alejandro Villanueva, Halapoulivaaiti Vatai, Josh Andrews, Dillon Gordon

This is still a very skilled offensive line. All indications are that Jason Peters is gone so I feel comfortable slotting him to be BDN’s blind side protector. Chance Warmack is making a comeback with Seattle. He may be a weak point, but he will have help from Peters and 2x Super Bowl Champion starter Stefan Wisniewski. Dennis Kelly has become a very skilled and versatile lineman since he’s left Philly. Alejandro Villanueva was raw when in our camp in 2014, but has become a Pro Bowl lineman. He can slide over to RT. Vaitai would be our sixth lineman and Josh Andrews and Dillon Gordon are in the NFL still so they could be good depth in the interior and at tackle respectively.

DL: Vinny Curry, Timmy Jernigan, Beau Allen, Michael Bennett, Treyvon Hester, Steven Means, Marcus Smith, Elijah Qualls.

Vinny Curry is another guy who is probably flocking away so I can list him here.  Beau Allen and Timmy Jernigan can dominate the inside while Michael Bennett can be a versatile guy you can have rush either inside or outside. Treyvon Hester is a valuable special teamer and can rotate in when needed on the DL. Steven Means is still in the NFL after tearing his Achilles last year. Marcus Smith was still somehow in a training camp last summer and Qualls was still playing professional football last months albeit with the DC Defenders in the XFL.

LBs: Jordan Hicks, Mychal Kendricks, Nigel Bradham, LJ Fort, Kiko Alonso, Kamu Grugier Hill

LB Corp is stacked. The 3 Super Bowl guys are still performing at a high level especially Jordan Hicks. LJ Fort became a starter for an intimidating Baltimore Defense last year. Kiko Alonso is still athletic enough to be a starter so having him as LB5 is terrific and Kamu Grugier Hill can bring leadership and ability to Special Teams.

CBs: Ronald Darby, Eric Rowe, Patrick Robinson, Jaylen Watkins, Josh Hawkins

Ronald Darby is solid when healthy (which is never, but whatever). Eric Rowe tore our hearts out in Miami last year and has become a good safety. In this case however, we need him to play CB and he has played it decently as he started in both Super Bowl 51 and 52. Patrick Robinson still makes a solid nickel CB. Jaylen Watkins and Josh Hawkins are emergency guys who are the best I could find.

Ss: Malcolm Jenkins, Patrick Chung, Deiondre Hall, Andrew Sendejo, Terrence Brooks

Malcolm Jenkins and Patrick Chung would be a good safety duo. I’d be curious to see how Chung would play under a competent Defensive Coordinator. Deiondre Hall could be third safety. Andrew Sendejo could still hit hard (hopefully it’s just not his own teammates) and Terrence Brooks is still floating around the NFL.

K: Cody Parkey

Sleeper Agent Cody Parkey has become a meme since leaving Philly, but he still had a few bright spots. Last year in Tennessee he was 3 for 3 on Field goals and they were all 40 yards and beyond.

P: Donnie Jones

Donnie Jones recently retired, but Old Man Bag O’Bones May be convinces by a big contract that allows him to keep his sweats on when he punts.

LS: Mike Bartrum

Our former long snappers are all retired. Jon Dorenbos was our last one, but he has a severe heart condition so I wouldn’t want to force him to risk his life and play for this crappy team. Instead we trot out our Assistant TE coach at the ripe age of 49.","Creating a 53 Man Roster of Former Eagles in 2020 QB: Nick Foles, Matt Barkley, Chase Daniel

Boba_Phett14,Possibly a way to still get a proven wide receiver.,"I know many people wanted to get a proven WR in free agency and are disappointed that we are drafting one. However in the many hours I have to sit and think today I thought of a good trade. 

I think that the eagles can swap 1st round picks with the Kansas city chiefs for a receiver like Sammy Watkins or Mecole Hardman.

The eagles get an above average wide receiver. The cheifs get to move up in the draft and clear up cap space ( which they don't have any). If you think its stupid call me stupid. Or prehaps it's too good that it will never happen. Im personally fine with drafting a wide receiver but I know many people wanted the eagles to trade for one.","Possibly a way to still get a proven wide receiver.

ShutupCommander,An unpopular opinion regarding retiring numbers,"Retiring numbers is a stupid concept. 

I’m a huge soccer fan and have watched legends leave their teams and their numbers to be worn the next season. You can celebrate a legends career in other ways besides retiring their numbers.

There will come a time where those numbers become scarce just like with some Hockey teams and then you’ll have to deny some legends their numbers retiring because you aren’t trying to run out of numbers giving the advantage to all those who’ve played back in the day so just abolish it all together. 

I’m in favor of something like holding out the number for a year and then putting it back in circulation.","An unpopular opinion regarding retiring numbers Retiring numbers is a stupid concept.

RandomUser516,Here’s Why The Eagles Should Trade Dallas Goedert,"So, the basis for this is the talk that they have been working on a contract [extension](https://www.si.com/nfl/eagles/news/zach-ertz-reportedly-turned-down-extension) with Zach Ertz.  For the record, I don’t think they should do that, I think they should let Ertz play out his contract and extend Goedert.

But, since they seem like they will extend Ertz past his age 32 season, here’s some assumptions I’m working with.

 - It’s hard to run 12 without limiting the offense.  Goedert was on the field for 66% of the snaps last year and it’s hard to see that number going higher.
 - If Ertz stays, Goedert will leave when his rookie deal expires, for a team where he can be featured.

Given those assumptions they should get some value for him now while trying to help the WR situation in one of the following ways:

 - Include Goedert in a trade package to move up on draft day to get one of the big 3
 - Trade Goedert for a young WR with 2 or more years left on his rookie deal, who’s shown some value with a draft pick either way for balance.  A Christian Kirk, Diontae Johnson type.  Obviously Courtland Sutton / DJ Moore would require too much from the Eagles to make that happen.
 - Trade Goedert straight up for a draft choice.  If Hayden Hurst can get a #2, Goedert should get at least that.

We’re going into Wentz’s prime now and and they can’t afford to waste years by not giving him not just targets but weapons to throw to.

I think back to McNabb, and apart from 2004 with TO and 2008/9 with Jackson and Maclin, he was throwing to garbage and it really limited the team and I hope they don’t make the same mistake here.   They’re trying, but the moves aren’t working out so far at least.

I think a move along these lines is a better situation than continuing to have Goedert play second fiddle behind Ertz until he leaves.","Here’s Why The Eagles Should Trade Dallas Goedert So, the basis for this is the talk that they have been working on a contract [extension](https://www.si.com/nfl/eagles/news/zach-ertz-reportedly-turned-down-extension) with Zach Ertz.

sblunt18,I got to wear Dave Spadaro's Super Bowl ring in London,"Hello all, I'm an Eagles fan from the Philippines. Me and my girlfriend at the time traveled to London to watch the Eagles. I found out about the official fan meetup in Admiralty Pub pretty last minute and fortunately enough we were already nearby. When we got there we saw Dave Spadaro at the back filming a segment.

[https://i.imgur.com/f9McCwz.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/f9McCwz.jpg)

While fanning out, this British guy (I forgot his name, sadly) approached us and asked us if we knew Dave. He then told us that him and Dave go way back and showed some pictures of them together.

[https://i.imgur.com/AeC3isq.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/AeC3isq.jpg)

Afterwards, he asked us if he wanted to wear Dave's SB ring. Of course I said yes and was super stoked on this!

[https://i.imgur.com/0lQ4Aav.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/0lQ4Aav.jpg)

Afterwards he called Dave over and we talked for a bit. He was surprised to meet a fan from the Philippines and he even interviewed me for his podcast!

[https://i.imgur.com/8GXAETK.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/8GXAETK.jpg)

Afterwards we went inside the pub and got a picture of Brent Celek holding the Lombardi (from afar) and Jon Dorenbos as well.

AdequateHusband,Looking for advice to save my only Eagles Jersey,"Due to a series of unfortunate events, my well worn and very precious to me Eagles jersey has become damaged. TLDR at the bottom. 

Our washing machine broke down. Unfortunately I couldn't fix it myself and due to the lock down in effect, it will be a couple of weeks before I can get anyone out to fix it.

A good friend offered to do a couple of washings for us in return. Unbeknownst to me, my sole Eagles top was in the wash bag and handed over. They must have washed it at a higher temperature and also tumbled it on high. (I wash it on delicate and always leave it to dry naturally)

This has caused the letters and numbers to pinch in, pulling in the material around it. It's still warm and somewhat damp having just been dropped off.

I'm reluctant to take an iron to it as more heat might make it worse.

Can anyone recommend how I can restore/salvage it or do I need to start saving for a new one?

robbiecapa,The Case Against Drafting Jalen Reagor,"Reagor is a talented and explosive collegiate playmaker but I hope he isn’t the target in the first round or in a trade back scenario. Reagor is blessed with incredible athletic traits and he is truly a special athlete. He reaches his top speed incredibly quickly and can change direction in an instant. He has the potential to be a RAC superstar. He is an aggressive ball carrier and he attacks defenders with a strong compliment of power and finesse moves. But after studying a few of Reagor’s games I saw a player with extreme boom or bust potential. A player who has raw athletic gifts, incredible ball carrier vision, but also significant flaws in his game. Although a talented receiver, he does not belong in the second tier with Jefferson and Mims and I am opposed to the eagles drafting him as their first wide receiver. 

Reagor’s athletic traits project him to be a favourable scheme fit in Philadelphia , yet I believe Reagor would be a wasted pick by the Eagles. He isn’t a natural hands catcher, he double catches or straight up drops passes consistently. Some drops are concentration drops while others occur because he is already thinking about running before he has secured the catch. He drops passes in all three levels. He doesn’t naturally track the ball over the shoulder. He uses his pads to help make over the shoulder catches instead of relying on his hands. He shows a lack of concentration when fighting through contact or traffic. Reagor’s hands don’t give me confidence that he projects well as a reliable target for Wentz. Coaching can help solve some of those issues but he has flaws at every level, from the screen the fade. That scares me, and makes me believe it can’t be changed.

It is worth sharing that Reagor had horrible QB play, maybe the worst of any prospect in this draft. That awful QB play really complicates his evaluation. There are clearly moments where Reagor is open by high school standards and his QB just doesn’t see him. If TCU had a top 30 QB this evaluation could be completely different. But it is Reagor’s reaction to this QB play that concerns me. I saw multiple plays where he was adjusting his towel when the ball was snapped on a run play, making him a step behind all his teammates or he complained about poor throws early in the game. He was the best player on that TCU team but wouldn’t put consistent effort into his play if his number wasn’t being called. If I was building a team, I wouldn’t want a player who doesn’t always give their best.

besse36,Draft Situation - Trading Up and the Repercussions,"It is no surprise that a lot of people believe the Eagles will use their 2020 draft resources (or possibly 2021 picks) to trade up and nab one of the top 3 WR's.  I do not disagree, but I can imagine the following scenario playing out. 

1. The first WR drafted is Henry Ruggs III by the Radiers.

terrapindance,Dane Brugler (The Athletic): Justin Jefferson Scouting Report,"* BACKGROUND: Justin Jefferson, who is the youngest of three boys, is the son of basketball athletes, but he and his brothers gravitated towards football. He grew up playing quarterback, but played primarily safety on the freshman team at Destrehan High School, moving to wide receiver as a sophomore. Jefferson was a latebloomer and started two seasons on varsity, on both sides of the ball. As a senior, he finished with 44 catches for 956 yards and nine touchdowns. Jefferson was also a track standout, competing in the long jump (21’11”), triple jump (43’0.5”) and relays. \[41\] A three-star wide receiver recruit out of high school, Jefferson was the No. 308 ranked receiver in the 2017 class and the No. 76 recruit in the state of Louisiana. He went widely underrecruited, partly due to his poor grades, receiving plenty of attention from junior colleges. With his family’s football background at LSU, Ed Orgeron extended an offer and remained interested throughout his pursuit of becoming academically eligible. Unable to sign or graduate on time, Jefferson finished a threeweek summer English class in June and became the final scholarship member of LSU’s 2017 recruiting class, joining the team a few weeks before the start of camp. His father (John) played point guard at Division-II Nebraska Western and Northeast Louisiana (now Louisiana Monroe). Both of his older brothers played football at LSU: Jordan (2008-11) was a three-year starter at quarterback and Rickey (2013-16) started at safety for the Tigers before a short stint with the New Orleans Saints. Jefferson elected to skip his senior season and enter the 2020 NFL Draft.

&amp;#x200B;

* STRENGTHS: Crafty footwork and savvy to create separation mid-route…uses hesitation and synchronized stems to snap out of his breaks…squares his body to the ball and attacks with his hands…competitive finisher and breaks tackles due to his body strength and toughness…leverages pursuit after the catch, setting up his cuts and forcing poor angles…fearless over the middle of the field, taking hits and keeping his feet/focus…tracks the deep ball well…mean-spirited blocker and won’t quit until after the whistle…wired right with the motivated, overachiever attitude that will aid his pro transition…impressive production, finishing his junior year second in the FBS in receptions (111) and touchdown catches (18) and third in receiving yards (1,540). 

&amp;#x200B;

* WEAKNESSES: Only average top-speed for the position…more quick than explosive…releases are a work in progress, occasionally taking too many steps to shake free vs. press…strong hands, but will battle focus drops at times (eight drops in 2019)…lean-framed target and lacks ideal bulk…lined up outside as a sophomore, but was almost exclusively inside as a slot receiver as a junior. 

&amp;#x200B;

* SUMMARY: A two-year starter at LSU, Jefferson was the “Y” receiver in offensive coordinator Steve Ensminger’s offense, lining up almost exclusively in the slot as a junior. He proved to be Joe Burrow’s favorite target the last two seasons, setting a single-season school record with 111 receptions in 2019, which is the third-most in a season in SEC history (behind Amari Cooper and Jordan Matthews). A throwback pass catcher, Jefferson attacks defenders at the stem and always works to get open, playing with the gritty mindset to finish in a crowd. Although not a burner, his detailed footwork and understanding of route depth create passing windows and always make him available. Overall, Jefferson doesn’t possess elite suddenness, but he is a seasoned route runner with the physical ball skills and competitive make-up that translates to the NFL, projecting as a quarterback-friendly target ideally suited in the slot.

JJAW was known for his red zone abilities, but he's not bad at getting downfield either. The issue is running routes. Most of JJAW's big plays came from him running vertical routes and using his physicality to box out smaller cornerbacks. Same thing in the preseason. He has decent hands, and he can catch, but he should be used in mid-range yardage situations to just run straight and move the chains after a solid catch.","They're using JJAW wrong I watched some of JJAW's college film to see if there's a specific reason why he had such a disastrous rookie year, and I think I have some insight.

mattman119,"Finally finished All or Nothing and... Josh McCown, man","SPOILERS (duh)

I don't watch TV very regularly so I was watching All or Nothing here and there and am obviously way behind the times on this. I just finished it today and needed to get it off my chest because... Fuck. Josh McCown, what a hero.

By this time I had read all the stories - how it was his first playoff game, how he played through his horrific injury, how he would still coach his son's high school team. And of course I knew how the game ended (ugh).

But when the cameras followed him back to the tunnel, and he saw he was alone, and just broke down on the spot... I wasn't ready for that. I damn near cried myself, and I am not much of crier.

The way he sacrificed his body and gave everything to win that game for this city when we needed him most is all that we ask from our players as Eagles fans, and while he didn't deliver a victory I think what he did earns him free drinks in Philly for life. Seeing how much the loss tore him up inside was gut-wrenching and he deserved a better ending, even if his body at age 40 wasn't capable of it.

Seeing that moment makes him one of my favorite all-time Eagles, even if he was here for only one season. If I ever meet him I hope it's at a place where I could buy him a drink, or at least say thank you.

Anyway, thanks for reading. Don't really care if this gets any attention - just needed to vent. Fuck, I'm getting emotional just writing this out.

Rob1Inch,Potential Trade Scenario,"After looking over some of the receivers that will potentially go in the 1st round in the draft, I personally think guys like Reagor/Mims, despite being talented, are too raw to be taken as early as 21 when there will likely be more polished talent at other positions. I also think given the amount of 2 TE sets we run, a primarily slot receiver like Jefferson wouldn’t be utilized effectively enough to justify taking him at 21. 

Ruggs would be great value at 21 but there’s maybe a 1% chance he falls that far, but I don’t know if he’s worth giving up more picks to acquire. However, I think Jeudy and Lamb are certainly worth trading up for. Jeudy is a monster route runner and Lamb is a dynamic playmaker. I think trading up to 10th overall, where Cleveland currently sits, would guarantee we can pick at least one of those two and I personally believe a reasonable trade isn’t as far fetched as some may think.

Last year, on draft day, Pittsburgh traded up with Denver from 20 to 10. They gave up their 2019 20th overall pick, their 2019 2nd round pick, and 2020 3rd round pick to make this trade. Trading up from 21 to 10 should be a relatively similar haul, especially given Howie’s ties to people in the Browns FO.

I think best case scenario for this trade would be the same format:
Eagles receive - 10th overall pick
Browns receive - 21st overall, 2020 2nd round (53rd overall), and a 2021 3rd

I think Browns would only accept this if they didn’t like the talent at certain positions of need at this pick. For example, if a few OTs come off the board early, Browns may look to move back and get better value out of a later pick. 

My problem with this trade is moving up from 21 to 10 is not the exact same as moving up from 20 to 10. Not sure if the Browns would want to move back that far, and I’m not sure if I’d be willing to give up much more than that to move up, unless Douglas would up the value enough (unlikely). 

With that said, I personally think that the trade scenario is reasonable within certain draft-day circumstances, and I think being able to jump in front of SF, NYJ, LV, and DEN for either Jeudy or Lamb would benefit us more than someone like Mims/Jefferson/Reagor/Shenault etc. at 21 and a second round pick. 

I’d love to hear any other trade ideas or any other potential problems with this scenario.","Potential Trade Scenario After looking over some of the receivers that will potentially go in the 1st round in the draft, I personally think guys like Reagor/Mims, despite being talented, are too raw to be taken as early as 21 when there will likely be more polished talent at other positions.

ShutupCommander,Tee Higgins will be the steal of the draft,"Regardless of the concerns that continue to push Tee down draft boards, I can’t help but fathom over the prospect he is and how much he is being ignored. 

I’ll make a huge prediction and that is Tee will be a top 2 receiver out of this class. Any of you can save this post and message me down the road if I’m wrong but if tape is an indicator of how good a prospect will be, then Higgins is nearly a sure fire prospect because most of his skill set is transferable to the pros. 

I’ve never seen someone with his body frame run such smooth routes outside of AJ Green. What CeeDee beats him in athleticism, Higgins makes up for it in the ability to use his size as a mismatch. He literally bullied corners off the ball when it’s anywhere in the region. His hand eye coordination is pinpoint remarkable. The “explosiveness” remarks are as lazy as you can get of a concern for Tee and the Arcega comparisons are just as poor. I understand that this is a deep class but mark this, CeeDee will be the top WR in this draft and second place will be a strong contest between Jeudy, another sleeper or Tee down the road. Only one of those 3 players won’t need a fortune traded for to get and we all know who it is. 

Jefferson is a safe pick because he will become that safety blanket that every QB loves to have but he isn’t a consistent pro bowl talent. I envision him having multiple 750-900 yard seasons playing 95% in the slot. Given who we have at WR now, I’d be fine with this selection but I know for a fact whoever gets Higgins will get a pro bowl caliber receiver that will have many GMs questioned as to why they passed on him.","Tee Higgins will be the steal of the draft Regardless of the concerns that continue to push Tee down draft boards, I can’t help but fathom over the prospect he is and how much he is being ignored.

TheRoadsBelow19-,I’m curious about the Eagles.,"Hey all,




I’m new to the NFL since the game pass has been free. I’m from England so never really thought to look into the American sports and now I’m gutted I didn’t. The NFL is awesome.





Now, I don’t have a connection to any team or city so I used a simulated team picker wheel thing and ended up with the last 3 teams to research into first. I have some questions so hopefully it’s okay to ask here.




What are the teams biggest needs? What are they targeting in the draft?




I’m catching up on last season via the game pass, but which players who had good seasons last year don’t have a long term future in Philadelphia?





I’m learning about the players and their roles but I’m struggling to fully understand. How many players are on the defensive side? And how do the Eagles line up, 3-4 or 4-3?




I want to come see the team live, how hard is it to get tickets? What are the best sections to sit in at the stadium?




What is the general feelings about the ownership?




Outside of the division rivalries, who are the other main rivals?




Can anyone give me some good videos, links or info on the team to learn the history and anything worthwhile for a new fan? I’ll be hanging around the sub so please bare with me whilst I learn the sport, rules, franchise etc properly.




That’s all for now, thanks all.","I’m curious about the Eagles. Hey all,

Blindsnowman,My thoughts on Eagles first round options,"This is really just my attempt to consolidate all my thoughts on this years draft, but feel free to let me know what you think/ agree/disagree with, i love this subreddit for it's discussions.

* Likely WR options

Justin Jefferson

The player most mocked to us, and to me seems the safest but most boring choice for us. As a fan of an SEC school(Go Gators!) and seeing Jefferson almost always getting open was quite frustrating and i can easily see that talent transferring to the nfl. But i really don't want our offense to be limited to 8-12 yard digs and slants, its plodding, boring and leave much room for error. Optimists think he could be and Keenan Allen type player, and while anything is possible I see Jordan Matthews as a more realistic comp.

   Denzel Mims 
     
This is a player that the more I see from him the more I like, though i'm a sucker for acrobatic catches. He has all the athletic gifts you'd want but doesn't consistently gain separation due to unrefined route running. the optimistic comp is Hopkins, but I see DJ Chark. To me has the highest ceiling of the group, but also requires the most projection.

Jalen Reagor
 
This has been my guy almost since the beginning. He's got the speed that just pops when you watch him so i don't think his combine 40 time was his optimal. Pretty well built despite his height and he's got good route running for what he was asked to do, but needs to expand his repertoire. He's closest comp would be an even better version of Nelson Agholor that we were suppose to be getting out of USC, but since I prefer babies my babies caught i'm going to say his comp is Santonio Holmes. I think he'll be the best available WR with the play-style our offense desperately needs.

 Fringe options

Laviska Shenault- Will be a walking injury risk his whole career, but if hes lucky he'' become what PercH harvin was meant to be minus the KR abilities. Dont want him.

KJ Hamler- Super fast, super quick, super small. You can hope he'll be Desean, but he has all the ingredients for current Agholor, speed, lack of size, and a case of the dropsies. Plus I think round one is a bit to rich for him anyways.

Tee Higgins- ....No  

* Likely DB options

CJ Henderson

Despite my orange and blue tinted glasses, I still think CJ is the second best corner in this class and that his lack of physicality is a little overblown. He is by far the best cover corner that would be available to us, he has the requisite speed, size and technique to be a very solid CB. And before he went to Deon Sanders this season he was a willing though not super effective tackler, and was solid with CB blitzes. I don't necessarily want want to go CB round one, but Henderson would be very good value here.

Kristian Fulton

ONe of the 30,000 first round LSU prospects this year, I think he is the only deserving one besides Burrow. He plays almost exactly like CJ Henderson but with slightly less athleticism and more of that CB cockiness. I think he would be a best CB fit for the current Eagles defense, but with all the new players we've added on the back-end this free agency I don't know what it'll look like come August. Plus i think we could get a discount Fulton during the 3rd round in one Troy Pride Jr.

Grant Depit

The ideal version of what McLeod should be. He's quick, smart, and while a bit trigger happy he has superior ball hawking skills. His only real Achilles heel is his tackling which originates from a shoulder injury he had back in 2018 i think. I like him, but not where we'll be picking, more of a high second rounder to me.

Xavier Mckinney

This would be the most frustrating pick for me, not for any practical reason but rather I already miss Malcolm Jenkins. The eagles would be drafting McKinney likely as a one-to-one replacement to Jenks, but if that's the case, why not just keep the original instead of looking for an inferior replacement. Sure Jenks was on the wrong side of 30, but i would bet at his age he is still more athletic then McKinney, who is limited physically and is rated so highly for his Football IQ. If they wanted to find a replacement they should have done it last year with Chauncey Gardner-Johnson, who at least has the athletic upside.



TL;DR  J.Jefferson, good player, not for eagles. I want J.Reagor. Eagles gonna draft a lineman. **Fuck Dallas**.","My thoughts on Eagles first round options This is really just my attempt to consolidate all my thoughts on this years draft, but feel free to let me know what you think/ agree/disagree with, i love this subreddit for it's discussions.

For the purpose of streamlining the draft, trades won’t be allowed (wish I could but I don’t see a way how to make it easy/effective). I’m trying to do the first two rounds before Draft Day, just out of curiosity. I will come back to update after three hours what the results were.

Jimbo12308,What is the plan at swing tackle?,"Hi all, curious to see your thoughts. I’m struggling to see what the team’s plan is for swing tackle. In my opinion, it is still a big need for us - and I don’t think it makes sense in the draft, I’ll explain:

We have Johnson locked up at RT for years. So that’s easy.

At LT we hopefully have a long term answer in Dillard. If things go well, we won’t need a starting tackle for years. So to me, that means it makes no sense to draft a tackle early, right?

Meanwhile, it also doesn’t make sense to draft a developmental tackle late. We already have a development project with Mailata, and a late round development tackle won’t be much help if Dillard implodes.

The perfect solution to me is an aged, cheap, experienced swing tackle. I thought Joe Haeg or Mike Remmers were good fits. However, a lot of those types of players are gone. So what could the team be planning?","What is the plan at swing tackle? Hi all, curious to see your thoughts. I’m struggling to see what the team’s plan is for swing tackle.

Guaminator18,The Eagle's FO uses Football's Outsiders as a tool for scouting WRs [I've got proof] (Or maybe I'm just bored and I'm shit posting... you'll have to find out),"I was reading this [article](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2414025-is-usc-wr-nelson-agholor-worthy-of-a-first-round-pick)  and I noticed they cited a Football's Outsiders' rank to say why Agholor was worthy of a 1st round pick in 2015:

""Football Outsiders uses a model called ""Playmaker Score"" to project collegiate receivers into the NFL. The system uses a variety of statistical measures gathered since 1996 to both predict professional functionality and compare players to receivers of the past 20 or so years. 

According to this year's projections, which were complied for ESPN Insider by Nathan Forster, Agholor ranks as the second-best receiver in the 2015 class, trailing only Cooper. The system matched him with Terry Glenn (No. 7 overall pick in the 1996 draft) and Ike Hilliard (No. 7 overall pick in the 1997 draft) among historical comparisons. ""

Just for fun, I went over the Football Outsiders' ranking of the past 5 years and I noticed that we have always drafted/ picked up players who were highly ranked by Football Outsiders. Is this a coincidence? Maybe, but it's quite funny that they have basically have matched our FO's draft with their rankings:

[2015](https://www.footballoutsiders.com/stat-analysis/2015/playmaker-score-2015): Nelson Agholor ranked 5th.

[2016](https://www.footballoutsiders.com/stat-analysis/2016/playmaker-score-2016): Cayleb Jones was ranked in the top 20, was picked up as a UFA.

[2017](https://www.footballoutsiders.com/nfl-draft/2017/playmaker-score-2017): Shelton Gibson was ranked in the top 20 (Although Mack Hollins was the last player rated in this draft class and we got him anyway).

[2018](https://www.footballoutsiders.com/stat-analysis/2018/playmaker-score-2018): Deontay Burnett was ranked in the top 20 (over guys like Robert Foster and MVS)

[2019](https://www.footballoutsiders.com/stat-analysis/2019/playmaker-score-2019): J.J. Arcega-Whiteside ranked 2nd over AJ Brown and DK Metcalf. 

So as a conclusion (TL;DR), we could make a realistic draft board with Playmaker Scores for 2020 for this upcoming draft. AND ALSO, VERY IMPORTANT, don't use this site's WR rankings for your FF because aparently, they suck (as our FO scouting WRs).

Before being traded to Buffalo and getting non-stop injuries, Matthews was actually a pretty decent receiver for the Eagles. [If JJAW had production anywhere near Matthews' first few years for the eagles then the season probably would have looked a little different.](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/M/MattJo00.htm)


Sadly, the biggest issues for the guy were drops and health. Which were crucial.


Somehow the narrative shifted to his biggest weakness being unable to play on the outside and now that is why people are worried about Jefferson. Personally, I don't think that's fair. If you told me that there was a player in this class who was similar to Matthews but A) Could catch exceptionally well and B) Stay healthy, then that player is worth a first round pick in my opinion. Because that looks like a perennial 1000 yard receiver.


I am not saying Jefferson is that guy, but the issues about being ""just a slot receiver"" are being over blown around here in my opinion.


TL;DR: Matthews couldn't catch and stay healthy, that doesn't mean slot receivers are bad.

I think the way he creates separation would make life a lot easier for wentz. Let me know about potential moves that are rumored or that you want to see happen.,0

WentzyleMania,A Reality Check,"I’m so thankful some of our fans on here are at home and not in the front office of the Eagles. I thank God every day Howie came out and said they value what we have at WR more than the fans and it’s for good reason. We don’t need to draft 3 WRs and ignore the team to satisfy our offensive wants. We have a good group if healthy, and we owe it to JJ to give him another chance or else we need to check who’s drafting the WRs bc we’re moving on. He struggles to get open but he made plays and had his sparks. I personally didn’t like that pick but he wasn’t as bad as we all think. I believe vet WRs that are on the market are better choices because we don’t pick very well in drafts for WRs if we’re being honest. If CeeDee/Jeudy is available (won’t happen) in the 1st I think that would be a super steal and definitely do it but other than that we need to take advantage of the studs all over this draft. I’m okay if we take a WR in the 3rd or 4th and we run with Alshon Desean JJ and that rookie. We need depth both sides and to get younger, it’s chess not checkers. A dream pick would be C.J. Henderson to play across Slay, I’m a Gator but he’s definitely super talented by an unbias review. I believe the no pro day/in person interviews will put us level to level with all GMs when making these picks, so Howie better not slip up. I think this team is talented enough and we just need some magic all over this draft. A Jordan Hicks in the 3rd would be nice. Find ourselves a few gems in this draft and i’m all in. 

Mainly wrote this because I miss football, no one wants to talk football anymore and everyone’s down and i get it but I DON’T KNOW WHY but I can’t stop being excited for Eagles fkn football. It’s every day, something about this off-season I just know Howie is taking advantage. I believe in the mf. Last hot take before i go; Desean goin for 1200 yds and 12 TDs this year, and it’s going to be just as disrespectful as it sounds🗣

PotatoeTaco43,7 Round Mock Draft,"Hey guys! I recently did a 7 round mock draft and here is what I did! I think I did a good job but not sure, feel free to comment on how I did! Trades were allowed by the way!

Trades:

Eagles receive: Brandin Cooks/ Rams receive: Alshon Jeffery

Eagles receive: 1.28/ Ravens receive: Derek Barnett and 2.53

Eagles receive: 1.12 and 3.89/ Vikings receive: 1.21 and 1.28

Eagles receive: 2.64/ Seahawks receive: 3.89 3.103 and 2021 6th

Eagles receive: 2.55/ Bears receive: 2.64 4.127 and 4.145

Picks:

1.12: Henry Ruggs III (Lamb went 10 with Jeudy going 7)

2.55: KJ Hamler (Traded up since he fell so far)

4.146: Trevis Gipson

5.168: Alohi Gilman

6.190: Michael Divinity

Overall roster afterwards:

QB: Wentz, Suds, Lauletta

RB: Sanders, Scott, Elijah Holyfield

WR: Ruggs, Cooks, Hamler, DJax, Gregatron, JJAW

TE: Zach Ertz, Dallas Goedert

LT: Andre Dillard

LG: Isaac Suamelo

C: Jason Kelce

RG: Brandon Brooks

RT: Lane Johnson

DE: Brandon Graham, Josh Sweat, Trevis Gipson, Anthony Rush

DT: Cox, Hargrave, Ridgeway, Malik Jackson

OLB: Gerry, Brown, Riley

MLB: TJ Edwards, Michael Divinity

CB: Slay, Jones, NRC, Maddox, LeBlanc, Douglas

FS: McLeod, Epps

SS: Jalen Mills, Will Parks

Overall: I think I did a good job of retooling Wentz but our LBs are still lackluster and we need a second edge. But both of these could be solved in FA by bringing in veterans such as Alec Ogeltree and Everson Griffen. A thumper RB like Carlos Hyde would work well too.

Misses: Players I wanted but couldn't get were Lamb and Jeudy at 12, Baun at 55, Cephus at 146, and Perry at 190.","7 Round Mock Draft Hey guys!

Anyways I wanted to ask you guys and each of the other NFL fan bases, some questions regarding the status of your roster, and they are as follows:

- What are your biggest needs currently for your roster? Try and be specific about this eg. 3T IDL or Slot CB

- What type of offensive/defensive systems or schemes does your coaches prefer using?

- What are your biggest needs in following seasons which could be as a result of upcoming contract extension or age? eg. Packers drafting Love to replace Rodgers. 

I hope to get a peaceful conversation going.","Hello, sorry to intrude, Packers fan here, I would like some help with a 7 round mock draft I’m doing.

eaglesnation11,Who is the most underrated Eagle of All-Time?,"We all have our opinions on who the best is of all time, but was wondering who you all thought was the guy in Eagles history who’s name does not get mentioned enough amongst Eagles greats and does not get the credit he deserves. I have a couple of nominations.

- T Al Wistert, a 6 time first team All Pro selection. Anchor on two NFL championship teams and has his number retired. Obviously the fact that he played 70 years ago as well as his position makes him so underrated.

- T Bob Brown, multiple All Pros, on the 1960s All Decade Team. In the conversation of best RTs ever. Didn’t play his whole career with the Eagles. Also time period and position hurts him.

- TE Chad Lewis, 3 straight Pro Bowls. Our history with TE success hurts him, but he was always reliable.

- DE Trent Cole, my best nomination for most underrated Eagle ever. Almost 90 sacks with the team. Never got a lot of recognition nationally and doesn’t get a ton of recognition when discussing team history today.

**It requires absolutely no sign-in of any kind, and you can submit as many games as you want.  It is an extremely simple form that just asks for YEAR, WEEK, AWAY TEAM, and HOME TEAM.**

Yourneighborsahorse,My theory on why the Eagles have not traded for Yannick Ngakoue yet.,"The Eagles value the trenches a ton, it is a well known fact that Howie Roseman and the Eagles are not scared to invest a ton of money into a defensive lineman. He is available but not available if that makes sense, so any way why haven’t the Eagles gotten him yet? 

Ngakoue has been posting story after story, liking tweet after tweet, all things Eagles. He has made it known that not only does he want out, he wants to come to Philadelphia. HUGE! 

The Jaguars have very little leverage. He wants to play for Philly and he is not afraid to show it. That is a deterrent for a ton of teams,not  only  NFC East teams. Nobody wants to trade away a ton of draft picks just for that player to leave. It could possibly happen to the Seahawks, if Clowney signs to another team. The idea of trading away a four year player for a one year rental will turn away a bunch of teams. He could simply not play if its not for the Eagles, that is a possibility. The Jaguars are risking not getting anything in return for such a talented player. 

My theory is that the Jaguars are not budging, but as time goes on they will lose more and more leverage. Howie loves draft picks, but he also knows a good deal when he sees one, and Im guessing he had not seen one yet. Remember, the Lions wanted a first for Slay but because he waited he ended up getting Slay for a third instead. It could be a situation like that. But you also have to keep in mind that the Jaguars didn’t budge with Ramsey and got a really good return on him. 

I think that the Eagles don’t want to give up a first at all bit thats what the Jags are simply not willing to budge as of right now. 

Anyone who is saying no is making me smh. He just turned 25 and he has been really productive his whole career and he is also only getting better. Yeah he might be expensive but he’s worth it. He can ball out and eventually replace BG when he inevitably leaves. 

Sorry if this reads really clunky and hopefully it makes sense or you at least see my pov.","My theory on why the Eagles have not traded for Yannick Ngakoue yet.

Apes_of_Matt,Conspiracy theories for what is keeping the Eagles from trading for Yannick Ngakoue.,"It seems pretty clear that Ngakoue has a lot on interest in playing for the Eagles. Given the Jag's asking price could be anywhere from a couple of day 2 picks to multiple 1st round picks, it would definitely be expensive to get him in the building, not to mention he would want a new lucrative contract once he got here. Those aren't easy pills to swallow, but he is a proven talent and a consistent play maker who I think would be an upgrade over Barnett, and at the very worst adds talented depth on a team that loves to rotate it's defensive line. He's also only 25 and his next contract should be for the prime of his career. I have a few guesses as to what is keeping the Eagles from making this trade happen and I'd love to see someone tear these ideas apart with their own baseless guesswork.

1) Is Howie worried about investing too many resources into the defensive line? 

2) Does he want to conserve picks for the upcoming draft? 

3) Does he want to wait for the price to go down, or see if he can get a discount from Ngakoue's camp before trading for him? 

4) He has traded for players during the draft in the past (traded for Ridgeway in the 7th round last year) and maybe he just wants to wait for the draft where he could find a little more flexibility in trades.

5) Did Howie bury his head in the sand just before the Clowney trade and he hasn't resurfaced yet? (It would explain how he missed that trade, but someone should check if he's breathing).

6) My current favorite theory: Howie is trying to set up a multi-team deal that would open up resources on the D-line, without having to sacrifice too many picks. I like trading Barnett and lower picks to the Browns who want to compete now, and may want players on the d-line who won't try to assassinate backup QBs. The biggest hole here would be that nothing is stopping the browns from trading for Ngakoue themselves.

Yourneighborsahorse,6 Round Mock Draft,"Trades: 

Eagles receive: 1(29), 3(93), 5(174)

Titans receive: 1(21)

——————————————————————

1(29). Denzel Mims(WR): He is a big body receiver, I watched and he is what the Eagles were really looking for in a receiver, big body who can bully people at the point of attack. But he is more than that, he is fast for someone who is 6’3, he ran a 4.38 40 yard dash, scary. He is also a good route runner, he has nice hands, and he BLOCKS. Would love to have him as the do it all guy for Wentz.

2(53). Antione  Winfield Jr(S): The Eagles have revamped their secondary and it looks really interesting, but I noticed all the safeties are on short term deals, they have no one for the future. Winfield can come in and be a rotational piece right away. He’s a ballhawk which is something the Eagles missed a lot last season. 

3(93). Nick Harris(IOL): The Eagles have a habit of drafting and developing lineman into really solid starters and I think Harris will keep it going. Harris is an investment, Kelce had toyed with the idea if retirement and it is always good to have a young backup in the wings. 

3(103). Logan Wilson(LB): Linebacker is really thin and he’s a tackling machine who also had his share of big plays throughout his career. He is good in coverage which helps a lot as well. 

4(127). Antonio Gibson(HB/WR): I can imagine the offensive minded coaches getting really excited about how they can integrate a wing- back into the offense. He plays both positions equally and he is fast. He would force the coaching staff to be really creative with their play design. He is the type of player that will depend on the coaching staff in order to be really good.

4(145). K.J Hill(WR): Hill is a very nuanced route runner which helps him get open and create space consistently. He could very well challenge Ward for the slot receiver spot. 

5(168). Parnell Motley(CB): Parnell Motley did a decent job being the Sooners number 1 corner, he played against a ton of talent an held his own. He was not invited to the combine, Im not sure why though? 

5(174). Cole McDonald(QB): He was uber productive in college thanks to his system. He could be a nice project QB for the Eagles. 

6(190). Carter Coughlin(DE): Would be very out of character for the Eagles not to get some sort of defensive lineman in the draft.","6 Round Mock Draft Trades:

WR and LB have emerged as the clear needs after FA. With the Eagles sitting at 21, i see 4 guys as the top candidates to get picked by us.

&amp;#x200B;

**Denzel Mims WR, Baylor-** Physical Freak, Superstar Potential and had his own video made by Brett Kollman, what's not to love?

**Justin Jefferson WR, LSU-** Slot Receiver for the National Champions, had an eye opening combine, looks like a safe pick.

**Kenneth Murray LB, Oklahoma-** I know the Eagles don't care about LBs, but this wold be an awesome fit with our defense, rangy and can cover? No Nate Gerry starting? Sign me up

**Patrick Queen LB, LSU-** Similar story to Murray, incredible athlete.

Personnally, i would get one of these 2 linebackers and then go for a WR, probably would try to trade up in the 2nd to snag one of the fringe 1st round wideouts.

Time-Ambassador,Anyone against taking a CB at all in this class?,"I personally hate the idea of taking a CB at all in this draft. With all of our other needs and the recent logjam, I just don't think it makes sense to grab a CB at all. 

After the top tier CBs are gone, most guys are JAGs and don't really have a chance to turn into a lockdown CB. Maybe I'm wrong, and I'd love to know what prospects you're targeting at some point in the draft, but I just don't see a reason to use a pick on CB when we can either fill a hole or add depth elsewhere.","Anyone against taking a CB at all in this class?

I made a game of it too. You go to one of those draft simulators and make picks, your picks are scored and you're given a total score at the end based on how penisy your draft is.

The way it works, when you put the name of the player in the cell next to the pick, it will calculate a scored based on round, type of name (match, pair, or stretch), and rank of the player. There's also two special players who will triple their score if you select them. It's set as a percentage, but you can score over 100.

SpectpoohEagles,I love the Eagles for relying on this year's WR draft and not doing FA for multiple scenarios.,"I can really see this going for 2 possible scenarios for this draft and honestly either one i'd be completely ok with. But im curious as to if you feel the same after i finish explaining them:

1.While yes the Eagles could sit there and just let the decide what WR they should target, lets say Howie does some out of character shit and actually does an ATL 2011 style trade to get either Lamb or Jeudy instead of letting the LVR or Jets get a hold of one of them, now if you guys don't remember that trade they basically gave up their first,2nd and 4th rounders that year along with a 1st and 4th the next year all to get one of the most dominant WRs we see today so we can easily say that was worth it. 

Ironically the Eagles can trade with the Browns to do the same thing, it would make sense considering the Browns do not need WR help and since they do not need to really worry about Lineman being picked up so fast in this draft they can afford to slide down and still get the guy they want.

2. The Eagles do stay put and let the WR they want come to them which is the most realistic option, they go ahead and take one of them in this draft that they know if they wait in the 2nd for it'll bite them in the ass for not getting the player in the first, that player would either be Jalen Reagor or Justin Jefferson most likely. 

I cannot see the Eagles getting big body WRs again considering they will be sticking with Alshon Jeffery and we know the Eagles are not the type to give up on prospects so JJAW is staying no matter what fans/media says. so they can just get someone that is a good deep threat but can really create separation as well no matter where he lines up.

3. The Eagles actually do decide to get a WR in the 2nd round and actually address a position that we didn't think they would care much about and thats LB. Between either Kenneth Murray or Patrick Queen in the first, that would not only address a massive problem for years at LB by getting one of these players BUT we would really see the potential this defense can have with a franchise LB along with a beastly D-Line and a revamped secondary. 

Truth be told the Eagles D can be top-10 but getting a franchise coverage LB can help put them in top 5 category.. this is actually the 2nd most realistic option they could do.

Either way with this draft, im very happy for because of the 3 routes the Eagles could go and im happy with either decision..

imo i hope the Eagles actually take the unrealistic option and just decide to trade up for Jeudy or Lamb. 

Lets be honest we all see these 2 WRs as either Deandre Hopkins or in Jeudy's case Amari Cooper with better hands and consistency for showing up in games.. As far as im concerned i'd give Carson that weapon asa fucking p without even hesitating because the positions we need to address are only a few imo and thats Power RB and LB. 

After that i can't think of anything else as the Eagles have done exactly what they could do in FA so why keep the picks if you are invested in a good amount of players until 2023 at the least. 

Go get your franchise WR in this draft, get a power RB in this draft and worry about next year where you can focus on anything else that could come up.","I love the Eagles for relying on this year's WR draft and not doing FA for multiple scenarios. I can really see this going for 2 possible scenarios for this draft and honestly either one i'd be completely ok with. But im curious as to if you feel the same after i finish explaining them:

1.While yes the Eagles could sit there and just let the decide what WR they should target, lets say Howie does some out of character shit and actually does an ATL 2011 style trade to get either Lamb or Jeudy instead of letting the LVR or Jets get a hold of one of them, now if you guys don't remember that trade they basically gave up their first,2nd and 4th rounders that year along with a 1st and 4th the next year all to get one of the most dominant WRs we see today so we can easily say that was worth it. 

Ironically the Eagles can trade with the Browns to do the same thing, it would make sense considering the Browns do not need WR help and since they do not need to really worry about Lineman being picked up so fast in this draft they can afford to slide down and still get the guy they want.

2. The Eagles do stay put and let the WR they want come to them which is the most realistic option, they go ahead and take one of them in this draft that they know if they wait in the 2nd for it'll bite them in the ass for not getting the player in the first, that player would either be Jalen Reagor or Justin Jefferson most likely. 

I cannot see the Eagles getting big body WRs again considering they will be sticking with Alshon Jeffery and we know the Eagles are not the type to give up on prospects so JJAW is staying no matter what fans/media says. so they can just get someone that is a good deep threat but can really create separation as well no matter where he lines up.

3. The Eagles actually do decide to get a WR in the 2nd round and actually address a position that we didn't think they would care much about and thats LB. Between either Kenneth Murray or Patrick Queen in the first, that would not only address a massive problem for years at LB by getting one of these players BUT we would really see the potential this defense can have with a franchise LB along with a beastly D-Line and a revamped secondary. 

Truth be told the Eagles D can be top-10 but getting a franchise coverage LB can help put them in top 5 category.. this is actually the 2nd most realistic option they could do.

Either way with this draft, im very happy for because of the 3 routes the Eagles could go and im happy with either decision..

imo i hope the Eagles actually take the unrealistic option and just decide to trade up for Jeudy or Lamb. 

Lets be honest we all see these 2 WRs as either Deandre Hopkins or in Jeudy's case Amari Cooper with better hands and consistency for showing up in games..

Which of these do *you* prefer them to do?,"Personally, i’m torn. pretty sure it’ll take a lot to move up to draft Lamb/Jeudy/Ruggs so I need to ask myself; are they that much of an improvement over jefferson where it’s worth losing that extra draft capital? I love Lamb’s elusiveness after the catch. reminds me a little of Alvin Kamara in regards to his contact balance. Ruggs has game speed (game speed vs 40 yard dash speed are two different things) that you just don’t see too often and desean is getting old. idk I just love both of them but jefferson is also a pretty solid choice and it most likely won’t cost us any sort of compensation to get him.

functionalsports,NFL Draft Trade Scenarios - Reddit Community Mock Draft v2,"Hey Eagles Fans!

I'm launching the 2nd version (post free agency) of the Reddit community mock. The first attempt was fun, but I didn't include trades and had a couple of other improvements to make. This time, I'm doing a bit of prep work. I'm going to ask a few questions and please discuss. It will help me facilitate trades for the his project. Simply up vote what you like the most and I will move forward with whatever option the committee wants. Then when all is said and done, I will launch the draft, have you make the selections. I'll also be facilitating trade offers between boards. This should be fun. Last time, we got 30 of the 32 boards participating.

Questions:

Would you trade down from the #21 selection? Yes/no? If so, what's the farthest you trade back?

Would you trade UP from your first rounder in order to grab another player you don't think will be there? If so, what pick range would you be targeting?

Would you consider trading later/future picks to move up for another first rounder? If so, what player or players would you target and where?

I'm going to keep a spreadsheet of scenarios and then when we're live, I'm going to have teams make the picks, propose trades and all that. Should be fun for NFL Draft geeks like myself (and you as well hopefully).","NFL Draft Trade Scenarios - Reddit Community Mock Draft v2 Hey Eagles Fans!

tehdirtysanchez,Why I believe we shouldn't trade up for WR,"Wide receiver is historically one of the most hit-or-miss positions to draft in the first round. Looking at this table of ALL first round receivers drafted in the last 10 years, how many would be worth jumping up the board for? 3 or 4? out of 32. None of the receivers in this draft are bust-proof, generational talents. The only precedent we have of a team jumping way up to get a WR is ATL with Julio Jones, and it took them 5 picks. I don't see Ceedee or Jeudy as Julio-caliber players worth at least 3 high picks to move up for. 

This draft is also one of the deepest at WR we have seen in a LONG time. It's not like there is a shortage of WR talent that we need to jump up to get a piece of. In fact, it is more likely that one of the top 3 fall into our lap at 21.

Tldr: Drafting WR in the first round is wildly unpredictable. With how many good prospects there are in the top 1-3 rounds, it's not worth selling our future to move up.

Yourneighborsahorse,Why is Alshon Jefferey still on the team?,"The way I look at Alshons tenure is he was a good player but his chemistry with Wentz held them from being a great duo. As much as Howie and everyone in that building says, you can tell Wentz and Alshon were never 100% on the same page. That became a little more apparent when Alshon looked really good playing with Foles. Maybe Im in the minority but that is what I saw. 

Then all the rumors of him and the things he leaked to the press, him getting into it with a key player in the locker room, and other suspect things here and there. If it was one rumor it would be different, but it was not an isolated incident. 

Howie is sending mixed signals about Alshon and his standing with the team. On one had he says that Alshon is on a mission to prove everyone wrong, but then he says he is the elephant in the room. The most suspect comment is when Howie said all Alshon needs to  do is get healthy... this could mean a lot of things. 

1. Alshon is not going anywhere. Im completely wrong and Alshon is on the team and plays really well. Howie said he needs to get healthy, because he obviously wants him to play. 

2. The Eagles are planning on trading him. They may have a couple teams that are interested but they want to him to be relatively healthy before they pull the trigger. 

3. They are waiting to see how their receiver room pans out before making a decision. There are still trades, free agents, and the draft, all ways to sure up the weakest position on the team. Dante Pettis has been brought up as a potential trade target, Watkins is a possible cap casualty, Demarcus Robinson is still out there. Obviously they also have the plethora of receivers in the draft. 

As of right now it looks like he will be on the team come opening Sunday. Is it smart? Who knows, he’s getting older, he is very injury prone, and has chemistry issued with Wentz. However moving him is a lot of dead money and he is still the best receiver on the team, can the Eagles afford to let him go?","Why is Alshon Jefferey still on the team?

Jag326,"My Eagles Madden Franchise may have the worst ""reality"" possible over the next four years. I could not help from sharing their (and my) misfortune.","TLDR: The Eagles blunder themselves out of the playoffs in epic fashion not once, twice, but THREE times, Dallas wins TWO Super Bowls, and Nelson Agholor enacts his revenge by becoming a star WR and winning a SB.

So, during this self-isolation society we live in, I have taken up playing the new Madden again, after kinda forgetting about it for some time. As a die hard, I decided I would play as the Eagles, and try to run the team as close to real life as possible. 

What has transpired over the redone 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022 NFL seasons is something out of a horror story. Philly, as a sports city in general, has been plagued by some bad luck at times in the past, but I’m not sure they would be able to weather what transpired over the course of my franchise. Without further adieu, let’s begin.

2019: The Eagles stay relatively healthy by the 2019 season standards, losing only Alshon Jeffery to a torn pectoral. Darren Sproles carves out a sizable role in his twilight season, but gets knocked out for roughly 4 weeks with a shoulder injury. Enter sandman—Miles Sanders, who becomes the team’s 3rd down and shotgun back, ultimately glueing what was an inconsistent Eagles offense together. With Howard and Sanders forming an impressive 1-2 punch, Zach Ertz doing Zach Ertz things, and DeSean Jackson, Nelson Agholor, and Cinderella story Greg Ward performing admirably in a move-the-chains like approach, the team turns in an impressive 13-3 season, fueling hope for a deep playoff run—which just so happens. The birds make it to an NFC title game agains the Seattle Seahawks, who beat the birds by two scores earlier in the season. What occurs after that is a slug fest. Over the course of an absolutely disgusting game, Carson Wentz throws 4 INT and loses a fumble. Despite this, with less than 2 minutes on the clock, the Eagles find themselves with the ball and a chance to win the game. Play after play, the Eagles push the ball up the field, completing clutch plays to Jackson, Agholor, and award. With :33 on the clock, the eagles find themselves on the SEA 25. The snap, Wentz finds Ward, who gets a block! 15-10-5—it looks like the Eagles will advance to the Super Bowl. 

Until Jadeveon ""That was a legal hit"" Clowney had something to say.

In what would go down as the worst moment in one franchise's history, and perhaps the greatest in another's, Clowney comes out of nowhere and strips Greg Ward of the football as he crosses the plane. Seattle recovers. The fan base is livid and beyond shock. Surely, he crossed the plane. Instant replay reveals that Ward loses control of the ball at literally the inch marker. Game over. Seattle goes on to win the Super Bowl.

2020: The Eagles pick up a talented young CB in the draft who will play into the future, as well as a MLB who turns out to become the team's starter, as well as a late round SS. They resign surprising breakout CB Sidney Jones to a 4 year deal. Jalen Mills is moved to safety. Malcolm Jenkins is released. Alshon Jeffery is traded to the Giants. Jason Peters is let go. Jordan Howard walks. Nelson Agholor is let go, signing with Tennessee. Nigel Bradham is released. Nate Gerry anchors a linebacker core of himself, TJ Edwards, and our young rookie. Pundits fear the Eagles offense, lead by an aged DeSean Jackson, Greg Ward, JJ Arcega-Whiteside, Miles Sanders, and relative ""unknown"" (in this universe) Boston Scott will not be sufficient.

The pundits are, unfortunately, proven correct.

The Eagles stumble throughout the season, though finding themselves at the end of it still in the race. With a chance to go to the playoffs on the line in Week 16, the Eagles are blown out by the Minnesota Vikings. The Eagles end 8-8, as the first team out. Even worse?

Nelson Agholor has a breakout year in Tennessee, and earns a spot in the Pro Bowl. 

EVEN WORSE?!

Jerry Jones watches joyfully as the perennial choker Dallas Cowboys go on to WIN the Super Bowl. Eagles fans are reported to have consumed 7.78% more alcohol than an average NFL fan that offseason.

One small silver-lining is that Nate Gerry turns out to be a star, recording over 100 tackles, 3 INT, and 3 sacks.

2021: The Eagles, very much choking from the cap, free up money by releasing Brandon Graham, Malik Jackson, Rodney McCleod, as well as letting solid cornerback Avonte Maddox walk, feeling that his asking price is too high (to provide background, I am a disbeliever in Maddox and watched him get torched all four years at Pitt, where I attended. I also had an ironic run in with him one night in McDonald's freshman year, where I drunkenly proclaimed ""yOuRe tHe fUtUrE mAN!!!!"", not knowing that, for my fandom, he was, in fact, the future. Avonte, if you read this, sry.) 

DeSean Jackson retires, :'(. 

The Eagles grab WR John Ross on a 2yr, 12 mil deal. They also, sparking a media firestorm for the ages--sign the golden prince himself, Nick Foles, to be the backup. In the draft, they land a blue chip DT to put next to Cox, and a WR who shows promise. The young CB we talked about in 2020 is now a starter. Genard Avery, Andre Dilliard, our late round 2020 SS are now starting.

2021 starts on a hot note, as the Eagles surprise people by going 3-0 to start. However, a young/weak secondary (Mills and our safety are struggling), as well as a still figuring it out D-Line, give up a lot of points over a stretch. In a pivotal game, in the later part of the season, Demarcus Lawrence records FIVE sacks on Carson Wentz, as the Cowboys steam roll the Eagles. People begin to hoard cheesesteaks, crab fries, and toilet paper. Is this the dark era of Eagles football?

Carson Wentz, with the critics on him, says no. The offense solidifies, the defense pulls it together, and the Eagles finish 9-7, grabbing a wild card berth. Unfortunately, Miles Sanders goes down with an ankle injury that will keep him out until the Super Bowl.

Wentz ends the season with 34 TD's and 6 INT. Miles Sanders records an 1000 yard season. John Ross has 65/800/10. Ward surprises. The rookie DT records 7 sacks.

The Eagles surprise their first two opponents, ending up in the NFC title game against--The Dallas Cowboys. In a tight game, the Eagles manage to find themselves with the ball, on their own 1, with zero timeouts and 1:11 on the clock. Wentz drops back on the first two downs, incomplete. Lawrence is manhandling Johnson (which, I must add, is complete horses\*\*\*). On 3rd down, the Cowboys play it conservative, faking a blitz. Wentz drops back--Lawrence goes inside--and Carson Wentz--

...steps out of the back of the endzone. Safety. Game over.

Eagles fans are praying to any all-powerful being they know, please, please do not let the mf Dallas Cowboys embarrass our QB and then win the Super Bowl. PLEASE!

Nope. Save your prayers. Dallas blanks the Bills in the big one, and Jerryworld is wondering what he did to get so lucky. Prescott-Cooper-Elliott continue to terrorize. 

Nate Gerry makes the pro bowl. The rookie DT does too. Wentz as well.

2022: The Eagles, desperate to stop what could be the beginnings of a dynasty, cut Seumalo to make cap room, and steal Connor Williams in free agency from Dallas. The Eagles are now starting the late SS and another late round FS at the safety positions. Foles is brought back. Gio Bernard is brought in as a 3rd back. Ward, Ross, Whiteside, Ertz, Sanders, Goedert form a strong cast of weapons for Wentz.

The Eagles start even stronger, going 4-0 to start. But a couple bad losses puts them at 4-2, back in the question mark. However, from that point on, it's pretty cruisy. The Eagles go 7-2, with three massive wins over the Giants (2) and Cowboys (1) to be 11-4 and with a chance at home field in the playoffs. But in week 17, in a questionable decision, they start a rookie at RG to give Brooks some rest, because Madden said they should, and they get drummed by an out of the race Bears team. Dallas wins the division at 12-4. The Eagles are on the road for wildcard weekend.

In a valiant, seemingly reminiscent display, they torch the Vikings 35-17, to find themselves with a divisional round match-up against--gulp--Dallas. The critics think the Eagles stand no chance, but they come out firing, leading 14-0 after one. However, Dallas storms back, and with 6min left in the 4th, the Eagles get the ball, down 21-20. Lawrence has been held in check all game, thanks to a double team by Brooks and Johnson, but a strong Wentz performance goes south when he throws an interception to Byron Jones on the PHI 40. Dallas goes down, makes it 28-20 with 5 min to go. Wentz, undeterred, gets the ball back and storms to midfield, before unloading a bomb to Ross, who out-muscles his defender 50 yards down the field to score a TD. The Eagles, however, miss the 2pt conversion. With hope slim, Jim Schwartz blows a blood vessel in his neck with his fiery speech to his defense, and the Eagles force a Dallas 3 and out to get the ball back with 2:30 to go. Methodically, Wentz and co go down the field, in a vintage Phillip Rivers/Chargers ""death by a thousand paper cuts"" style approach. In hurry up mode towards the end, the Eagles get to the Dallas 16, stepping out of bounds with no timeouts, 20 seconds left. Afraid that they may somehow run the clock out, Pederson elects to kick the field goal. Timeout Jason ""I did not get fired in this world, but instead somehow have become almighty and awful"" Garrett. On the sideline, Jake Elliott keeps practicing. Some say that he had Thai food before the game, and was in a constant state of discomfort. Others say that he felt the pressure. With a middle of the field chip shot field goal, offering to send the Eagles to the NFC title game, Brooks snaps to Foles, and Elliott--

\--doinks it off the right bar! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!

Dallas wins 28-26, but thankfully loses in the Super Bowl... to the Titans, behind a #1 WR in the NFL season from Nelson Agholor.

In the span of four years, three of the most chokeworthy plays in simulated NFL history--a fumble at the 1, going in for a GW TD to the Super Bowl; stepping out of your own endzone on the final drive to go to the Super Bowl; and doinking a GW playoff FG--all happen to the Eagles. 

Final notes, summed up:

Dallas wins two Super Bowls.

The Eagles choke in epic fashion three times in the playoffs.

Nelson Agholor becomes a star receiver.

Thankfully, this is not reality, as if it was, Philly probably burns to the ground.","My Eagles Madden Franchise may have the worst ""reality"" possible over the next four years. I could not help from sharing their (and my) misfortune. TLDR: The Eagles blunder themselves out of the playoffs in epic fashion not once, twice, but THREE times, Dallas wins TWO Super Bowls, and Nelson Agholor enacts his revenge by becoming a star WR and winning a SB.

So, during this self-isolation society we live in, I have taken up playing the new Madden again, after kinda forgetting about it for some time. As a die hard, I decided I would play as the Eagles, and try to run the team as close to real life as possible. 

What has transpired over the redone 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022 NFL seasons is something out of a horror story. Philly, as a sports city in general, has been plagued by some bad luck at times in the past, but I’m not sure they would be able to weather what transpired over the course of my franchise. Without further adieu, let’s begin.

2019: The Eagles stay relatively healthy by the 2019 season standards, losing only Alshon Jeffery to a torn pectoral. Darren Sproles carves out a sizable role in his twilight season, but gets knocked out for roughly 4 weeks with a shoulder injury. Enter sandman—Miles Sanders, who becomes the team’s 3rd down and shotgun back, ultimately glueing what was an inconsistent Eagles offense together. With Howard and Sanders forming an impressive 1-2 punch, Zach Ertz doing Zach Ertz things, and DeSean Jackson, Nelson Agholor, and Cinderella story Greg Ward performing admirably in a move-the-chains like approach, the team turns in an impressive 13-3 season, fueling hope for a deep playoff run—which just so happens. The birds make it to an NFC title game agains the Seattle Seahawks, who beat the birds by two scores earlier in the season. What occurs after that is a slug fest. Over the course of an absolutely disgusting game, Carson Wentz throws 4 INT and loses a fumble. Despite this, with less than 2 minutes on the clock, the Eagles find themselves with the ball and a chance to win the game. Play after play, the Eagles push the ball up the field, completing clutch plays to Jackson, Agholor, and award. With :33 on the clock, the eagles find themselves on the SEA 25. The snap, Wentz finds Ward, who gets a block! 15-10-5—it looks like the Eagles will advance to the Super Bowl. 

Until Jadeveon ""That was a legal hit"" Clowney had something to say.

In what would go down as the worst moment in one franchise's history, and perhaps the greatest in another's, Clowney comes out of nowhere and strips Greg Ward of the football as he crosses the plane. Seattle recovers. The fan base is livid and beyond shock. Surely, he crossed the plane. Instant replay reveals that Ward loses control of the ball at literally the inch marker. Game over. Seattle goes on to win the Super Bowl.

2020: The Eagles pick up a talented young CB in the draft who will play into the future, as well as a MLB who turns out to become the team's starter, as well as a late round SS. They resign surprising breakout CB Sidney Jones to a 4 year deal. Jalen Mills is moved to safety. Malcolm Jenkins is released. Alshon Jeffery is traded to the Giants. Jason Peters is let go.

Time-Ambassador,Post your top 10 Wide Receivers for the Birds in this class,"1. Vinyl Goat- Best WR in this class; he is physical, sure handed, a leader, and elevates his game with competition (see LSU game)
2. Henry Ruggs III- Yes, Ruggs is our 2nd best available option; has a limited route tree, but has shown glimpses of understanding route running nuances at Bama. I think his speed and overall explosiveness fits exactly with what the league is transitioning to, and is specifically what we were missing last year across the board.
3. Jerry Jeudy- Great player, hard worker, AMAZING route runner. Comes from a recent line of prolific route runners from Bama, which leads me to my one concern. Amari Cooper also runs a great route, but hasn't transitioned to where he was expected in the NFL. That said, I think Jeudy is much better in terms of confidence, and has much better hands. Would love him on this team as well.
4. Denzel Mims- Lot of different opinions on this sub about him. He is big (fits our need on the boundary), he is fast (one of the faster 40 time and 10 yard splits), and he has hands. This is a guy I would be ready to trade a few picks back for and take him in the 24-28 range. He will be a stud in the league. Look what he did at Baylor, and now imagine that with someone like Carson throwing to him. Would be screaming for us to take him if the top 3 are gone.
5. Laviska Shenault- This is my real surprise pick because so many people hate the idea of him. However, I am not taking past injuries into account; based off of just talent and skillset, this guy oozes potential. That said, we should not be taking him unless he somehow fell to Rd. 2
6. Jalen Reagor- Explosive, quick, shows signs of understanding route running (didn't have to do much at TCU), but his drops are a MAJOR problem. His skillset is exactly what the Birds want/need out of a WR, but those drops, drop him.
7. Brandon Aiyuk- Same as Reagor, except drops aren't the issue; I have major concerns about the Pac-12. Sole reason why he is this low. That said, I think he could be a great add, so long as the Pac-12 defenses are not the reason he looked so good.
8. Michael Pittman Jr. - Has really come alive in draft talks and shot up boards since combine season started. He has decent speed, runs a great route tree, and more importantly has hands and runs with a desire to take it to the house every time. Not your average Pac-12 WR, plays big (and is big).
9. Justin Jefferson- Not big, decent speed, but lacks explosion, and more importantly is a slot guy only. Look at his film before this year; he does not win from the outside, which is exactly what we need. Athleticism limits him big time. That said, he is one of the more sure-handed receivers in this class, and if we were looking to double dip and he was somehow there at 53, then by all means, take him.
10. Tyler Johnson- Not really a big fan of the other X receivers after the first 8, so I think Johnson would be a slam dunk pick in Round 4 (if he lasts). This guy is younger than the other slot receiver who could have been here (Van Jefferson), which is the main reason he's number 10. He is a WICKED route runner, with sure hands. He is just a smaller guy 6'1 206 lbs, who may have some potential to play on the outside, but seems to be a slot guy. That said, love his game, love his ability to get open, love his hands, and love his explosion.

Yourneighborsahorse,If the Eagles had the 1st overall pick who would you pick?,"I would pick Isaiah Simmons. The more the Eagles talk about their new approach to defense the sadder it makes me we cant even sniff at the idea of getting Simmons. 

It seems like the Eagles will really be emphasizing versatility on defense, they called Mills a position-less player, signed Parks who is a good nickelback and Maddox can play inside, outside, and safety. 

So why Simmons? Because he plays defense. He is the perfect pick for the Eagles, they can line him up anywhere because he can play every position in defense. He is the ultimate weapon on defense and can very well  be a once in a generation player. 

Imagine all the ways Gym Shorts could use him on defense, a lock down corner, a top 5 defensive line, and a player who for one quarter can play linebacker, another play safety, another pass the rusher, and then mix it all up for another one. We could have an exciting defense. 

But alas, the Eagles have the 21st pick and Simmons will most likely go top 10.","If the Eagles had the 1st overall pick who would you pick? I would pick Isaiah Simmons.

Signings:

RB Carlos Hyde (1 year/$2.5M) ~12.5M left

WR Taylor Gabriel (1 year/$2.5M) ~10M left

We get a replacement bruiser back after losing Jordan Howard and get a speedster to be a low end WR on our depth chart.

Trades:

Trade Picks 21, 53 and a 2020 3rd Round Pick to Cleveland for Pick 10.

Trade up to get a legitimate WR1 for Wentz

Draft:

Pick 145- C Matt Hennessy/Temple

Pick 146- S Brandon Jones/Texas

Pick 168- RB Eno Benjamin/Arizona State

Pick 190- WR Quintez Cephus/Wisconsin

We get our WR1 for Wentz, a physical and versatile LB and a potential backup LT if Mailata still isn’t ready with the first three picks. With the second half of our draft we get a potential gritty Kelce replacement, long term safety depth a pass catching RB who could be a development project and an athletic depth WR.

superbowlfoles3,5 FAs we could still sign (Including 4 Chiefs!),"Because we gave Slay and Hargrave backloaded contracts, and because Parker, Coleman, and Brown all cost $2 million or less, we still have a chunk of cap space left. From this point on short term deals are the name of the game, although I'm not as alarmed about next year's cap as a lot of fans are. Mostly because we will clear a lot of cap by turning some of Cox and Wentz's salaries into bonuses, restructuring/extending Graham who doesn't have much garunteed money left, and by post-June 1st cutting or trading Alshon which will clear $13 million for 2021. Because we have cap space this year and the ability to clear cap next year I think we are still in the free agent game. Now here are some names that could fill our remaining needs, most of which happen to be Kansas City Chiefs, something I did not plan on at all before writing this: 
**Bashaud Breeland, 28 year old CB**- Played well for the Chiefs during their Super Bowl, holding together a secondary that was seen as the Chiefs' biggest weakness before. His biggest strength is coverage skills which we desperately need. Would be our #2 corner. **Potential contract: 3 years, $6.5 million per year**
**Demarcus Robinson, 25 year old WR**- He's impressed in limited snaps. He's kind of been in an Ertz like situation where people have expected him to break out for a while. This past season was supposed to be the year he finally did but then the Cheifs drafted Mecole Hardman who stole his thunder. Robinson has size and speed and could seamlessly transition from Andy's offense to Doug's. **Potential contract: 2 years, $5 million per year**
**Everson Griffen, 32 year old DE**- A lot of talk about Yannick but Griffen could be a cheaper option who can step into a Long/Bennett/Curry type role. Despite his age he's gonna be heavily persued as an accomplished veteran at a premium position. But Howie has never had problems landing DL talent so I'm sure he can pull this off if he decides to. **Potential contract: 2 years, $7.5 million per year**
**Reggie Ragland, 26 year old LB**- Sorry about the third Chief but we still need linebackers. Ragland can play WILL or SAM linebacker and projects to the Bradham role for this defense. He could start alongside Jatavius Brown with Gerry or a draft pick on the weak side. He's struggled in coverage but so does every other Jim Schwartz linebacker. He's young and can keep our run defense afloat so the DL can focus on rushing the passer. **Potential contract: 2 years, $3.5 million per year**
**Darron Lee, 25 year old LB**- This is the last Chief I promise. He will be cheap because he hasn't proven anything in the league so far. But he has the speed/physical tools. This would be a departure from Jim Schwartz's usual big, thumping linebacner, because Lee is as small as it gets for the position. But he would bring coverage ability which we've been missing from our LB group. **Potential contract: 1 year, $2.5 million**","5 FAs we could still sign (Including 4 Chiefs!)

whiteandcrispy,I made a (somewhat shitty) draft pick trade calculator so people can see what we'd need to give up to move around in the draft,"Hi all,

Quarantine gets to all of us, and I decided to use some of my time to throw together an excel-based spreadsheet that allows people to see what it would take to move around in the draft based on the conventional pick value systems.

The google drive link is below. It is not editable to prevent everyone trying to use it online, plus google sheets sucks. Please download to access it. I am not sophisticated enough to program a virus:

[Google Drive Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Tcc2CFsHG5dzd4YfSkW_oORyUrSSjAlY/view?usp=sharing)

**How to use:**

You will see two tabs in the model. These contain the draft values under the original Jimmy Johnson created system, as well as what is supposed to be a more updated points system created by Rich Hill. All sourcing data here is per [https://www.drafttek.com/NFL-Trade-Value-Chart.asp](https://www.drafttek.com/NFL-Trade-Value-Chart.asp).

The value to the right of the pick number and team it belongs to is the value under the current system you're looking at. I have highlighted the Eagles picks for easy of comparison.

To the right you will see the 'Value of Acquired Picks' and 'Value of Offered Picks' tables. You should only be editing the seven blank spaces in the boxes under 'Pick Number'. Again **please only edit these cells**. 

All you need to do is enter the number of the picks you want to get, and the number of the picks you're willing to give up in those two boxes. The point value will appear next to them automatically (if this doesn't work, check that your excel is in automatic calculation mode. Shift+F9 will work if you're in manual), and then be summed down below. Currently, the model is set to the values of us trading with the Browns up to #10 by offering #21 and #53. The model suggests under the JJ system that we'd need to offer more, and suggests a basically fair trade under the Hill values.

The +/- section will tell you where the balance of the trade is. Below that, you'll see boxes titled 'Single-Pick Difference?'. This will show you the round of pick you'd need to add *at a minimum* to get closer in range if you're only adding a single pick. It's a basic calculation that only checks the low end of the round's value vs. the trade point difference. I.e. there's currently a 130 point difference under the JJ values, so it suggests a third round pick as the values of those range from 82 - 265.

To account for future picks, the rough estimate that I've seen is that they should be discounted one round per year. I.e. a 2021 first round is worth a 2020 second round. Tinker accordingly.

**General Notes**
* This is pretty simple, half assed model so please don't expect it to teach you how to be a GM or account for lots of variables
* Excel pros: don't judge my shitty Index Match 
* I didn't watermark or put my username anywhere on this, so feel free to share with whoever. Just don't be the dick who uploads it to r/NFL and claims it's yours
* I had originally attempted to password protect all cells except for the ones you should be editing, which again are **just the pick number cells on the right-side boxes**, but apparently that doesn't translate through Google Drive. If for some reason it is locked for editing, it should only request a password on the cells I mentioned above. Password: greasethepoles

[Google Drive Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Tcc2CFsHG5dzd4YfSkW_oORyUrSSjAlY/view?usp=sharing)

**How to use:**

You will see two tabs in the model. These contain the draft values under the original Jimmy Johnson created system, as well as what is supposed to be a more updated points system created by Rich Hill. All sourcing data here is per [https://www.drafttek.com/NFL-Trade-Value-Chart.asp](https://www.drafttek.com/NFL-Trade-Value-Chart.asp).

The value to the right of the pick number and team it belongs to is the value under the current system you're looking at. I have highlighted the Eagles picks for easy of comparison.

To the right you will see the 'Value of Acquired Picks' and 'Value of Offered Picks' tables. You should only be editing the seven blank spaces in the boxes under 'Pick Number'. Again **please only edit these cells**. 

All you need to do is enter the number of the picks you want to get, and the number of the picks you're willing to give up in those two boxes. The point value will appear next to them automatically (if this doesn't work, check that your excel is in automatic calculation mode. Shift+F9 will work if you're in manual), and then be summed down below. Currently, the model is set to the values of us trading with the Browns up to #10 by offering #21 and #53. The model suggests under the JJ system that we'd need to offer more, and suggests a basically fair trade under the Hill values.

The +/- section will tell you where the balance of the trade is. Below that, you'll see boxes titled 'Single-Pick Difference?'. This will show you the round of pick you'd need to add *at a minimum* to get closer in range if you're only adding a single pick. It's a basic calculation that only checks the low end of the round's value vs. the trade point difference. I.e. there's currently a 130 point difference under the JJ values, so it suggests a third round pick as the values of those range from 82 - 265.

To account for future picks, the rough estimate that I've seen is that they should be discounted one round per year. I.e. a 2021 first round is worth a 2020 second round. Tinker accordingly.

**General Notes**
* This is pretty simple, half assed model so please don't expect it to teach you how to be a GM or account for lots of variables
* Excel pros: don't judge my shitty Index Match 
* I didn't watermark or put my username anywhere on this, so feel free to share with whoever. Just don't be the dick who uploads it to r/NFL and claims it's yours
* I had originally attempted to password protect all cells except for the ones you should be editing, which again are **just the pick number cells on the right-side boxes**, but apparently that doesn't translate through Google Drive. If for some reason it is locked for editing, it should only request a password on the cells I mentioned above. Password: greasethepoles

RomanBeanstalk,Anyone else like the idea of bringing Cam Newton as Carson Wentz's backup?,"For Cam Newton, it's the Chargers or no one at this point. The Chargers likely give him the starting spot when he signs. Every other team, he will have to earn it.

I am kind of hoping the Chargers don't sign him so the Eagles can get him as a backup to Carson Wentz. I know what many will say, Newton won't sign if he is backup. Convince him that this will help him. He gets a year to heal his injury while being on the sideline. And should Wentz get hurt, he has a great organization behind him. Pederson made Foles work, he will make Newton work. Just sign him to a 1-year deal. During the season if a QB gets injured in the NFL, a team will absolutely call the Eagles and see what it takes to get Newton. My guess, a 3rd or 4th round pick.","Anyone else like the idea of bringing Cam Newton as Carson Wentz's backup? For Cam Newton, it's the Chargers or no one at this point.

24plus8is32,Why sign Robby for 20 when you can have Carson throwing to undrafted scrubs? Eagles are taking Carson Wentz for granted.,"That's my main problem. 

Eagles have no right to be picky when your best WR is undrafted Greg Ward (DeSean has DUST for bones. Alshon is a rat)

Carson Wentz is one of the best QB's in the league and the Eagles can' get this motherfucker any goddam help.

It is fucking insane to me that Eagles would decide to penny-pinch at WR after what took place last year. 

Also trading up in the draft doesn't fix our WR problems unless you think a rookie WR is going to transform an entire offense (LOL no way that happens) 

This reminds me of what just happened in New England, New England took Tom Brady for granted and he left them because they couldn't get the proper weapons to win.

ManiJohnston,Quarantined Free Agency and Draft Thoughts,"With all this time on my hand, I wanted to share my thoughts on possible free agency pickups and some draft prospects that I haven't seen mentioned a lot.

FREE AGENCY:

2) Everson Griffen: His last contract with the Vikings was around $8.3 million (I think). That would be a sexy addition to our already stacked Dline.

Jimbo12308,WR in rounds 1 &amp; 2?,"Hey all, so a few of the recent moves (and lack of moves) got me thinking about likely draft strategies. For a while I’ve been thinking the team might go WR in round 1 and S in round 2. But I’m starting to think they might go WR and WR back to back.

CB is a commonly cited need as well, but with plenty of young corners on the roster (including a part time corner in Mills) and with Slay now providing lock-down services on one side of the field, I think they’ll let CB2 be a competition between their internal options (and likely a later round rookie like Amik Robertson who they brought in for an interview).

Bringing in Will Parks, and Mills, and McLeod lessons the need at safety. The need is still there since Parks and Mills are on 1 year deals, but we don’t need to fill a safety 1/2/3 role immediately anymore, so a later round S might be more likely.

Grabbing Jatavis Brown lessens the need at linebacker as well. Once again, still a need, but not as immediate.

What hasn’t happened yet is a FA wideout, and there have been reports that the team want to stay with young options there to grow together and will likely avoid the big name receivers. So they might not land the speedsters Anderson or Perriman. So that creates a need for a speed receiver.

The trouble with getting a speed receiver in the draft is that its Ruggs...and then everyone else. Meanwhile, the team traded away some draft capital, which will make moving up for Ruggs harder.

Jefferson is constantly chosen as our pick at 21 in mock drafts - but he doesn’t fill the speed role. So what might happen is picking the speed guy in round 2 - KJ Hamler. He has drop issues, but we are only pounding the table for a speed guy as insurance for Desean. So hopefully our young speed receiver won’t be our starting speed receiver.

Essentially, what I’m seeing is needs being filled (S, LB, CB) while other needs are left open (WR) and simultaneously trade up options (for Ruggs) being reduced, which leads me to think that they’ll get their immediate contributor in Jefferson and their speed insurance plan in Hamler.

Obviously BPA still plays some part. If it’s possible to move up for Ruggs on the cheap, they’ll do it. If some unbelievable LB or S or CB is available at 21 (or 53), they’ll do it. But I think it’s possible that the plan going in might be Jefferson/Hamler based on all the other moves (and lack of moves) we’re seeing.","WR in rounds 1 &amp; 2?

I think the Eagles wanted the $ to pay Slay.   

I think they are confident in the Green Goblin--Mills-- in the S role and think he will be quite a good value.  

The Eagles probably plan to draft a S and need the roster spot. 

I think the leadership factor is more of an issue on the D and especially in the secondary.  Maybe a different vibe will help to develop the young CBs, especially Jones. 

Finally the Eagles seem to be in a mini-rebuild mode.   It makes sense to go with younger options.","The real reasons Eagles parted ways with Malcolm Jenkins I don't disagree with Clark's two most prominent reasons but disagree with the priorities of them.

You'll have to pay him a huge extension when we have MASSIVE contracts across the Dline already. Unless one or two of these guys are moved, where/when does everyone play?

This doesn't help us with the fact that every QB was getting rid of the ball in under 2 seconds anyway, completely undermining the idea of a stacked Dline. We need to disrupt qb/wr timing with corners.

PBC_Kenzinger,If the Eagles don’t go WR in Round 1,"Almost every mock has Philly drafting a wideout in the first. If they don’t, who do you think they draft? 

I have a feeling the Eagles draft an edge rusher, Epenesa or Gross Matos should both be in that range. Either that or trade down a few spots for S Delpit.

I’d sort of love for Howie to do something very un-Eaglelike and draft LB Patrick Queen. I feel like we’ve had mediocre revolving door linebacker play since Trotter.

Night0wl11,Remaining Cap Space,"Alright, everyone. I've been seeing questions that relate to how much cap space we have remaining now that some of the holes in free agency, so I thought I would provide some numbers here. Normally, I would completely defer to Spotrac or Over The Cap, but they tend to only post the contracts when they have absolute contract numbers. As fans, we may not need the exact cap number, but a ballpark estimate could go a long way to know exactly how much we're working with and who we could realistically target for the rest of free agency.

So, based on what Spotrac has for our payroll, we're looking at about $26.4 million for the accounted for cap space, which includes the $7.3 million needed for our draftees, but is missing Slay, McLeod, Park, Brown, and Ridgeway from our book. Now, OTC has Slay's contract at $10.5 million, which would make sense, as our deal with him was an extension and the guarantees like signing bonus from Detriot would stay on their books, so our remaining cap space drops to $15.9 million. As for McLeod, Zach Berman gave us [this info](https://twitter.com/ZBerm/status/1240702748628152320?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1240702748628152320&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redditmedia.com%2Fmediaembed%2Fflesqu%3Fresponsive%3Dtrue%26is_nightmode%3Dfalse), which would be a cap number of $4.3 million AAV, as it doesn't include the incentives to bump up his cap number to be the $12 million deal we initially heard. Will Park's deal, [according to Mike Kaye](https://twitter.com/mike_e_kaye/status/1241443573440090112?s=09), sits at $1.6 million for the year. With those deals factored in, we're down to $9.9 million remaining. The numbers that we don't know about are Jatavis Brown and Hassan Ridgeway, so, if we're trying to have a general sense of what we have, we can say that their deals are closer to Park's deal, so let's say $1.5 million AAV each. With that, our current amount of cap space will drop to $6.9 million for the year. With Rasul on the trading block, there's potential for him to free up another $2 million, but this should give us a fairly realistic number for how much cap space we have left.

If I did my math wrong somewhere or if there's more info that can be used to update this, feel free to let me know. I've probably fudged the numbers wrong somewhere or may have missed a tidbit of info that would be helpful here.","Remaining Cap Space Alright, everyone.

W1ze3yes,Broncos fan coming to say you got a good one in Philly Will,"Y'all are gonna love Will Parks. The only reason we didn't resign him is because it was a choice between resigning him or resigning Justin Simmons and Simmons is just a better player. He and Simmons were drafted in the same class and pretty much all Broncos fans were expecting him to leave, kinda like Shaq Barrett last year, but I was really hoping we could keep him somehow. 

That isn't to say anything against Will, he just got in a spot where he was in a full safety room and he wanted to be a starter. I saw a few Eagles fans asking in the Broncos sub so I figured I'd give a little more insight into his game.

He is extremely versatile. He'll play in the Box, he'll line up in the slot, plays pretty solid man and zone. He's probably better closer to the line, but I never worried if he was playing deep. He's also one of those players who isn't gonna give up on a play, if people are still running, he's gonna be involved. I honestly can't think of a time when he missed a 1 on 1 tackle either. He hits hard, but plays smart.

Even with limited playing time since he got to Denver, he played better every year and constantly showed improvement.

Last thing I'll say, he's got one hell of a personality. He's great with the community and with the media and always seems happy. He LOVES Philly and I'm honestly super happy that he's gonna be an Eagle.","Broncos fan coming to say you got a good one in Philly Will Y'all are gonna love Will Parks.

Casual_WWE_Reference,Which 5 players will wear the 'C' this season?,"Based on who wore them last year, and the current roster construction, there's a chance we only have two, at most three, of last year's captains, meaning there are voids to fill. Obviously, Wentz and Cox will keep theirs, and if Kelce does not retire, him as well, which means you have to replace Jenkins and Grugier-Hill.

If you want to split them to both sides of the field, offense is a little easier. I think there's cases to be made for Zach Ert, for obvious reasons, but I could also see an argument for either Brandon Brooks or Lane Johnson (however this seems more likely to happen if Kelce retires). Defense is a little harder. Rodney Mac is our longest-tenured secondary member, but I'm not keen on him wearing the C, however, players like Gerry, Mills, etc. aren't really ready to be team leaders. However, Malik Jackson hasn't really played enough for us, and everyone else on the line is either new or doesn't see enough time to justify the C. Therefore I think the answer would likely be Brandon Graham.

All of this is relatively meaningless but I thought it might be a fun discussion.","Which 5 players will wear the 'C' this season?

Sidney Jones has shown flashes of talent, but hasn't gotten on the field very often.  While some of that has been due to injuries, there's has to be more.    I suspect there is something about his attitude, preparation, etc.  

The Eagles also have a promising slot CB in A. Maddox.  However he too has shown flashes but had some problems.   I suppose that is not unexpected for young players. 

Bringing in a Pro Bowl CB might provide an opportunity for both Jones and Maddox to learn what it takes to be a successful NFL CB.","D. Slay's Impact on S. Jones Even if Slay is only an above-average CB on the downside of his career, he might actually help solidify two CB spots, or more.

LumberjackWeezy,WR market is very low right now. Good time to make a move (on Anderson)?,"Historically speaking, rookie WR's don't usually have much of an impact on their team.

eaglesnation11,Alshon and a 2nd for OBJ?,"Apparently OBJ rumors are rampant again. We would get rid of Alshon and send over a 2nd round pick to Cleveland in exchange for OBJ. We would free up 18.5M for next year by executing this trade now. OBJ would not only provide Wentz with a #1 target, but also a cheaper one as OBJ is expected to carry a cap hit of about 15M over the next two seasons.

For the Browns they move on from a distraction and they get a WR who albeit overpaid can still be a solid #2 option. They also get a 2nd which in a deep OL class could really improve their protection for Baker.

So any thoughts on this trade? Who says no?","Alshon and a 2nd for OBJ? Apparently OBJ rumors are rampant again. We would get rid of Alshon and send over a 2nd round pick to Cleveland in exchange for OBJ. We would free up 18.5M for next year by executing this trade now.

whubby777,NFL Game pass is totally free from now until May 31st. What games are people watching?,"I’m currently enjoying the 37-9 beat down of the cowboys, where Kamu took over kicking duties and Doug kept going for 2. Probably going to check out the 2017 bears game, or the 2017 broncos game, before watching some of rookie Wentz.

Probably going to also go back and watch Foles’ 7 TD game. Also watching the Snow Bowl, as that was my girlfriend and I’s first Birds game we watched together, and it will be fun to rewatch it together all these years later.
